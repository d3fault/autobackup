Right now it's hard-coded to d3fault's campaign 0, but I'm about to make it accept campaign owner and campain index as args. This got me thinking about how I could possibly make it scale (scaling wasn't my objective when coding it the first time: functionality was). Obviously I can't monitor every doc in the dht "once every second" when there are theoretically millions of docs (campaigns). So as a hacky as fuck solution, I could trigger JIT monitoring-mode "for a few minutes"(?) right before the buy event is event attempted. It's KIND OF like "session" management, but not really. This is downright dirty hackery. Basically I modify abc2 itself and inject a step just before the most important LCB_ADD (filling the slot with a slot filler). The step injected: tell this monitor code to monitor the campaign about to be purchased. If notifying the monitorer fails, the buy is never attempted! I could additionally make it more failsafe by notifying a few monitorers. Like say out of a few hundred monitors, I could tell 5 of them I'm about to fill a slot, and then proceed with the slot fill once 3 of those 5 respond (in case some are down). Any notified monitorer just monitors that doc for a bit, a few minutes sounds like a good number I just pulled out of my ass, and that is it. The end. Fucking easy and now the app scales holy shit so much further.
