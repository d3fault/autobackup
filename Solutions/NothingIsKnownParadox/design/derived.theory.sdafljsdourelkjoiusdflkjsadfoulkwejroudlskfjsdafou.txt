wild theory: the initial attempt at determining whether or not nothing is known (or put more realistically "what is this?") triggers the while(true) loop (esq) that provides the foundation for life itself. It doesn't matter that our consciousness and self awareness is on a different level (though I can't put into words why) and that we aren't constantly thinking/asking/toggling it.
