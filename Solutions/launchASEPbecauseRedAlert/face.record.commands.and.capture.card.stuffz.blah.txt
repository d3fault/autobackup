//raspivid writes to stdout, so it is intended that it is netcatted along an [offline/secure] network and saved using "Hottee". This/these are our "master" copies

//That particular pi is using component (yellow) video output, which is plugged into my TV Wonder Pro and being captured on an internet connnected computer (the raspivid _PREVIEW_ is being captured <3). Note the cropping params in the following command are probably specific to my ATI Wonder Pro, other cap cards need to recalculate them

ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -s 720x480 -aspect 3:2 -channel 1 -i /dev/video0 -b:v 110000 -vcodec theora -an -r 10 -map 0 -vf crop=720:452:0:17 -f segment -segment_time 180 -segment_list_size 999999999 -segment_wrap 999999999 -segment_list segments.txt -reset_timestamps 1 face-%d.ogg


//Then we simply watch that segments.txt for activity. ffmpeg appends a filename to it when it starts that segment, so we begin uploading the previous segment right when a filename is appended. It *might* be possible to begin uploading right as ffmpeg is encoding, so long as ffmpeg only ever appends to the file. I am unsure. It might even be possible to start http serving up the partially uploaded .ogv file, but that would probably qualify as "streaming media" anyways.
