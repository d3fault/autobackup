Comment: Section 14 of the D3fault Public License allows comments
   in header files to be incorporated in an Application's object code.
   Considering I tend to write ideas and pseudo-code in comments right
   when I think them up (whether or not they are even related), I
   won't risk allowing any such ideas/pseudo-code to be taken and
   used in a proprietary application. This might just be me being
   overly paranoid, but I'd rather be on the safe side. You can use
   the actual parts (non-comment source code) of the header files
   under section 14 of the D3fault Public License knowing in good
   faith (whatever that means) I won't bring a copyright claim against
   you. At a later date and after moving all such comments to their
   corresponding source files, I will re-release the header files
   under the D3fault Public License. All that being said, API
   (which is essentially what a header is) isn't copyrightable anyways
   (see: Oracle v. Google), so you're allowed to regenerate headers
   without even requiring permission.
