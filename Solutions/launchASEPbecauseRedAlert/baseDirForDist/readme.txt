==HOW TO PLAY VIDEO (.webm) FILES==
A recent version of VideoLAN's VLC ( http://videolan.org/vlc/ ) should play the VP9/Opus encoded .webm video files, but you can also use Chrome or Firefox 28 (which releases March 2014)

==AUDIO (.opus)==
Again, VLC will play .opus files, and so will Chrome/Firefox/Opera

==PICTURES (.webp)==
Pretty sure VLC doesn't handle pictures, so your best bet is Chrome/Firefox/Opera



Derp: "How do I open those files in Chrome/Firefox/Opera?"
	A: Click-n-Drag the file you want to open from your operating system's file browser onto the running Chrome/Firefox/Opera window (if you can't figure that out, turn off your computer)
