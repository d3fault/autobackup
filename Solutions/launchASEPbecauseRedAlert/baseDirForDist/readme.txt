==Legal/Copyright tl;dr Summary (not to be considered legal text)==
You have legal permission, and are also encouraged, to copy, modify, and share all of my files (so long as you pass along that ability to anybody you share the files with). For more information (the actual legal text) on _YOUR_ right to copy, modify, and share, see the files 'copyright.txt' and 'license.dpl.txt'

==HOW TO PLAY VIDEO (.webm) FILES==
A recent version of VideoLAN's VLC ( http://videolan.org/vlc/ ) should play the VP9/Opus encoded .webm video files, but you can also use Chrome or Firefox 28 (which releases March 2014)

==AUDIO (.opus)==
Again, VLC will play .opus files, and so will Chrome/Firefox/Opera

==PICTURES (.webp)==
Pretty sure VLC doesn't handle pictures, so your best bet is Chrome/Firefox/Opera

==PICTURES (.svg)==
Use Inkscape. Most web browsers will render the text incorrectly

==PICTURES (.xcf)==
GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)

==DIAGRAMS (.dia)==
Dia the diagram editor for UML designs etc

==OTHER (.c, .cpp, .h, .cs, .s, .php[s], etc)==
If you don't recognize a filetype, try opening it in any text editor (or your web browser I guess)



Derp: "How do I open those files in Chrome/Firefox/Opera?"
A: Click-n-Drag the file you want to open from your operating system's file browser onto the running Chrome/Firefox/Opera window (if you can't figure that out, turn off your computer)
