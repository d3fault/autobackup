[x] - Prepare Data
[x] - Upload Data (Freenet Full Copy, Start Seeding Torrent)
[x] - Finish Bitcoin Key Gen
[x] - Code hacky/shitty "abc" (probably single-user to start ("dogfood"-ONLY)) to be hosted from home on business connection
[x] - Hack together shitty video solution + webpage (it being a 'user of' abc2)
[] - Merge old archive and new (keeping binary and text separate. binary could (instead?) be a master repo that isn't sync'd with often (since slow). HackyVideoBullshitSite expects one repo is all (I guess it doesn't have to, I could easily merge two .lastModifiedTimestamps into one timeline-ify'd one... so long as the directory contents either didn't overlap or had a /binary/ and /text/ prefix separating))
[] - Convert timestamp format of old (and semi-old) archive to new .lastModifiedTimestamps type
[] - Convert svgs from "flow" to "text" on both old archive and new
[] - Get everything in place, including support scripts to do it (upgrading MyBrain, inode-aware directory building, etc)
[] - Valgrind everything
[] - Test in Release mode
[] - Manual for Abc2 (+tools) + HackyVideoBullshitSite (+tools) configuring and running... for myself and others...
[] - Buy hardware + move out + set up hardware
[] - Launch via 1337/dirty h4x, leaseweb most likely (get offline backup however/hackily (use offline machine being recorded by another offline machine AND by an online machine (probably multiple vga splitters). 3 machines, 2 offline. The one you type/broadcast on does not record (might also need code testing filming solution). Same setup for your face)) (user/d3fault/data CAN contain only: sha1/md5/magnet (freenet, bittorrent), decryption key/password to it all. Will eventually actually server the data)
[] - Implement anything and everything in any order and at any speed (80%-max relaxed (I am a coding addict, so [...])) for the rest of this life
[] - Die
[x] - Repeat Infinitely
