New book intro (first/dedicated page) for "Mind Dump 0-25 (Part 1/2): Mating Call of a Big Bang" (part 2/2 could be "Mind Dump 0-25 (Part 2/2): I Accidentally Like Transexuals". The old book intro took itself too srsly

Hey ladies, I desparately need to replicate my genetic code. Please have sex with me. Aren't you impressed with how much of a genious I am? You might think I have homosexual tendencies, but you'd be wrong. I just have a thrill-seeking/experimental mentality and I accidentally like transexuals from watching too much blowjob porn. I'm into kinky psychological sex shit. I'll dress up as you and you dress up as me for a few hours/days/months/years. The goal is for me to forget who I really am. You'll one day grab me by the shoulders, frantically shake me back and forth, and yell "YOU ARE STEVEN". I'll probably have to go to a shrink in order to remember who I really am. So my question is this: under what name should the shrink bill me?
