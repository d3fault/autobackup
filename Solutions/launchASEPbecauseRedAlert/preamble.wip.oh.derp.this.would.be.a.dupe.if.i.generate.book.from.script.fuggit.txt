This book is full of stupid (hence the title). If you want a higher signal to noise ratio, read it backwards. The only downside to reading it backwards is that you'll now be lacking context. That pretty much summarizes life as a whole: you can't be smart without first being stupid/insane. Intelligence is the eventual dissemination and organization of stupidity/insanity. Aww shit I think I just plagairized Einstein.

Getting OT now: backwards is the way knowledge is taught in schools. "Here is the solution. Sure it took so and so his/her entire life to come up with, but here it is: e=mc^2". No wonder we have so many idiots running around.
