I've changed a lot since starting this journal/diary/book. Initially I was depressed (denial) and suicidal, but now I'm near publishing and I can say I'm feeling blissful and love life. Don't feel sorry for me when you read my pathetic writings. I've changed and I'm not ashamed of how pathetic I was. I'm publishing this nonsense for the sake of science. We start off as a single point and then explode...

This book is full of stupid (hence the title). If you want a higher signal to noise ratio, read it backwards. The only downside to that is that you'll now be lacking context. That pretty much summarizes life as a whole: you can't be smart without first being stupid/insane. Evolution is the rapid dissemination of stupidity and the eventual assimilation of intelligence. Aww shit I think I just plagairized Einstein.

Backwards is the way knowledge is taught in schools. "Here is the solution. Sure it took so and so his/her entire life to come up with, but here it is: e=mc^2". No wonder there are so many idiots running around.
