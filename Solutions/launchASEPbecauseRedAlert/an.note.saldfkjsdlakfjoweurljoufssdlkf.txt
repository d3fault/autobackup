I need to use a business connection and monitor it in realtime for when I get 'somethingDotted' and my server will get overloaded by those. I need to detect them fast and to then set up coral caching for those specific mirrors. The mirror list will grow and I'll probably get faster and faster at it. I will always be trying to find a way to detect influxes of connections from a specific mirror. Always looking for that perfect formula. I know already I can do a hacky one.
