gah
not all bank action requests will be initiated by wt client requests
fml
the best/only example i can think of: automated payouts (i GUESS this code could live on the bank server itself... idfk where is 'appropriate'. actually pretty sure on the bank server is most appropriate)
so now the question still stands... are there any bank requests that aren't triggered by a wt client request??
