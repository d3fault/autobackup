I'm not sure my cache/master plan will even fucking work lmfao. BUT IT'S OK. My Rpc Generator that I'm currently working on has nothing to do with that.


My reasoning for doubt: How do I query a view on the cache?
EXACTLY

brain = fucked


the query needs to be done on the master, and therefore the cache is a fucking useless layer.

fuck it~



HOWEVER, hmmm...



wait what

what the fuck is the point of rpc generator now?


Wt clients on outsourced <--> Bank Server?
or
Wt/Qt(appdb/bankserver) on one machine? IDFK ANYMORE LUL


i mean sure it has uses for other shit


but like, uhm, what?

if everything's on the same machine i don't need this rpc layer (but can use it with QLocalSocket lol)



what the fuck


is


the purpose


of rpc generator



if there is no middle layer?



did i just collapse my entire design into a single-machine design?


oh fuck....




again, it isn't COMPLETELY wasted
for example, inter-'neighbor' communication could use it (broadcast notification)


lots of future apps would use it


but will ABC????


I don't know what I'm doing anymore...


even if I don't use Rpc Generator for ABC, should I still finish it because I'm balls deep in the logic? I want to say yes (I hate leaving projects ALMOST-FINISHED gah)

but I also need to launch asep to get teh blingz

FUCK
MY
LIFE

i wish i never wrote this document

what made you think keeping two couchbase clusters synchronized like that was a good idea?
I'll tell you what: most operations are GETs, thus require no master hit

FUCK
MY
LIFE

grr I'm mad.

time to suicide
