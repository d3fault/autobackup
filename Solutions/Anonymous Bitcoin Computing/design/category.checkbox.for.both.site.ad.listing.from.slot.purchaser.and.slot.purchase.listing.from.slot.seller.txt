The admittance of a "site to be listed" and the selected categories for the image/ad must be approved before any slots can be purchased for a price.
The approval is done by an hourly worker to just glance at an ad and see if it falls under certain categories
OR, the approval is done by the site owner. the check marks are still automatically checked by some code to see if they fit. But if an owner complains, a paid worker needs to be the tie breaker.
there needs to be a form for the client to object one more time, which triggers approval by a different paid approver. they can only dispute a dispute once per dispute.
