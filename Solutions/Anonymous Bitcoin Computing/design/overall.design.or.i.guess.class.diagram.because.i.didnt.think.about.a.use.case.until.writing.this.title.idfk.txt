i'd love to have a dia diagram with every class in the Wt Front End, every class in the AppDb, and every class in the Bank Server
it would be fap worthy~

i have to make it if i want it

maybe i should....
....idk

i just know i get to obsessed with designs and never write code
but maybe that's a good thing?
it lets me sort out problems that are harder to sort out when staring at C++ code

makes it easier to see the big picture


hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
YET-ANOTHER-TANGENT



although not _REALLY_
design is an integral stage of development
and this project is actually kind of big.
