if i use the ssl key to determine what sub bank-account an AppDb gets, then i can't scale AppDb up without re-using the same key (and this will complicate who to send responses to. or does it not matter since AbcAppDb has a cache of this stuff anyways? this is not so much of an optimization as it is a safety feature. double checking. and saying 'i am now attempting to purchase this' (blocks other attempts). the bank has the final say though.)
anyways, the solution is simple. a single bank sub-account can have multiple public keys (therefore AppDbs) associated with it
