so yea i should have A anarchy-a B bitcoin-b C [something idfk? copyright symbol seems out of place, maybe something computer related? what about the cent sign? like dollars cents. idk]

^^^^but anyways so yea that, but to show that i am not a threat (a la anarchy) i have a picture of myself as the background (of an 'enter' page?) doing thumbs up with a retarded ass smile

it has to work
it's either that or i kill myself because it beats starvation + boredom
