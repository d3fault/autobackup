because "trademark use in advertising comparing against competitors" is encouraged!

color code: Y = green check mark graphic, N = red X graphic

not necessarily in that order

			[ABC Trademark]		[Google Trademark]
Proprietary Content		Y			N
Is Disallowed

Doesn't spy			Y			N
on you
(host proof hosting
 + "disconnected ads")

Is Secure			Y			N
(security is opinion
 my opinion is insecure
 because of no host
 proof hosting)

Open Source			Y			N
 and Free Software

Completely Transparent		Y			N

Free "Gratis"			Y			N

Free "Libre"			Y			N

Doesn't Censor			Y			N

Wizard to launch		Y			N
 your very own
^TODOreq




the very last one is:

Uses Advertising		Y			Y
to stay alive

^^the last one should be the only one where they are both green. because advertisements are arbitrary

Funny, the timing
Google used to be Free "Gratis" until only recently when they started charging for Business Apps. owned themselves. I had it as a Y initially because idk I thought it was. I guess it depends on what services. For the estimation, I am implying ALL services. Business Apps (using your domain) is a service of Google Inc. and charging to it means that not all of Google Inc.'s services are free "gratis".
