Squirb
just thought of it as a completely alternate/transparent/alias to ABC
because tbh, ABC might very well be a bit too long...
Squirb will have like a pink squid thing that is both an animal (squid) and spelling the letters of the Trademark

it's shorter and easier to memorize and might be available
MIGHT
no fucking clue
i have never heard the phrase before now (at least i don't think i have)

it's my "2.0" approach
leave everything the same, pink cute squid with cheesy/shitty 2.0 name

It is just an ALIAS to ABC
I can create as many as these alias/alternate-skins-really-ROFL as I please

Ok so:
domain -> skin-selection
the end
