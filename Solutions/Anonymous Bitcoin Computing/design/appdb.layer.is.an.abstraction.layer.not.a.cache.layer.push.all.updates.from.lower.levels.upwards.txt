if every call to the appdb from a wt front-end has to use the network, including reads, then the wt front-end does not function properly as a cache
the bottleneck becomes the appdb
which i only barely have designed to scale up
i need to use a wt db as a local cache
i guess it's possible... the lower levels will simply PUSH whenever a change occurs

bitcoin bank server (onChange) ---PUSH--> AppDb (onChange) ---PUSH--> Wt Db (incorporate with the usernamedb)

so reads do NOT require connecting to the AppDb... but i mean writes do obviously...

the "AppDbHelper" (which communicates over a thread with Wt directly) is where i register to be notified of updates (say, funds have been added)
so if i push EVERY change, this will function as intended


AppDb isn't necessarily a cache level in this sense.. it is an abstraction level
and a consolidation/final say as to who has what. a central database. the application database. hence the name
to think of as a cache level is incorrect
