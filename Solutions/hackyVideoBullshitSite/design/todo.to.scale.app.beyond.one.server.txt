After the sftp upload from local -> server, I need to implement some way to propagate the file to all the Wt nodes. To start I'll just have one so eh I can hold off on coding that for a little, but it's needed to scale. I thought about using libtorrent or just daisy chaining more sftps... but haven't landed on anything yet...
