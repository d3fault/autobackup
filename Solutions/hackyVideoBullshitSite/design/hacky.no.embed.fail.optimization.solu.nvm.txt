I'm not sure if this would work at all and it sounds like it would require http request continuations, but a way to make the video stream not... embeddable on other sites... is to access it as a WResource (private, non-global). I'd need a customized WResource that basically just servers up the (??? http stream? raw video stream? prolly one or the other and trial+error would do it). Would also need some synchronization code so that we re-use the same chunk of memory already read in to supply all users. Right now my video is not even going through Wt, Wt is just linking to an external (VLC powered) http URL. This idea could maybe use libvlc or even hackily get the bytes off of vlc's stdout (*cough* yes I've done this before (with help) *cough*). The idea isn't that complex but would essentially require a wt session to be able to access the resource. A person could still proxy the stream, but they couldn't simply embed it (actually, they can already embed the entire wt app so wtf am I on about...)
