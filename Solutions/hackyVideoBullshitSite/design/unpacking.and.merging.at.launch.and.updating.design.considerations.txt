-Extract MyBrain (7z)
-delete autobackupLatest.zip that was in MyBrain (or whatever it's called. redundant/stale. there might even be two of them)
-un-prepend header (guh) of MyBrain text files (xml/svg doesn't really matter (str replace hyphens with underscores imo), and fuck bash too since extra hacks)
-Molest heirarchy (easy tree format pretty sure), delete those timestamp files. PROBLEM: Filenames of compressed don't match (.LLQ.etc), splitting binary/text needs to also split the entries in timestamps files
-Create Simplified Last Modified Timestamps file (quickdirty-esq)
-Extract or git-clone currentText repo
-Molest currentText with simplified molester
-separate oldBinary/oldText && currentBinary/currentText via file extensions
-merge oldText<->currentText && oldBinary<->currentBinary (NO OVERWRITES!!! folder merges pose a problem (especially for projects))
-make mergedBinary and mergedText repos. these are my master copies from then on (the above stuff is only run once) <-- and once again for uncompressed copies (although slightly modified, because autobackupLatest.zip isn't there, nor are headers prepended (note:only binaries have a compressed variant (uncompressed does not hit web server for legal (codec) and cost (bandwidth) reasons), text does/will not))

at this point we have /binaries/ and /text/ git repos
[Also entry point for a git push]

-make a copy of, and prepend copyright headers to, mergedText. this copy is only used when the user presses "download". binaries can't have header prepended, and would be hella expensive to copy anyways. HVBS needs to be smart and know that binaries don't have an alternate download location
