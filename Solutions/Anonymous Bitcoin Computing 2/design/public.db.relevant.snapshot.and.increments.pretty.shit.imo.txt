Dependency snapshots of the entire [relevant(keep reading)] Abc2 database ensuring that the state of the db snapshot is pristine and there are no "partial" _ANYTHING_s, is to query Campaign0 and then to iterate the lastPurchasedSlot (and all of it's dependencies) all the way down to slot 0. Ok nvm about pristine (would need full journaling), an inaccurate document could be the user-account doc: they could have made a purchase etc just after you hit 'take snapshot', so that their purchase was for a slot that is after the slot you are snapshotting against (their balance would be inaccurate), or their user-account could also be locked. But for the most part: slots, transactions and fillers could be gathered into a 'relevant site backup' (actually it's pretty fail critical, since users who haven't made a purchase would lose their balance xD. changing to word relevant)..... and would also allow me to easily generate daily 'increments' (simply slot ranges of the campaign doc (but re-used slot fillers should somehow refer to the same one if referenced again in a future increment))
