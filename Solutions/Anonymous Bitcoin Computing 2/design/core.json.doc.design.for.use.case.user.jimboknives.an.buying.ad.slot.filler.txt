d3fault is selling adspace, and this is his "0th" ad selling campaign. It is confusing at first, but the below key/doc is accessible at: abc.com/ads/buy-ad-space/d3fault/0 . The user is buying the ad space being sold, so that's what they type-in/see

//AD SPACE BEING SOLD CAMPAIGN -- regular up and running full doc (alternates/variations below)
adSpaceSlotsd3fault0
{
  "minPrice": "0.001",
  "slotLengthHours": "24",
  "lastSlotFilledAkaPurchased": {
    "slotKey": "adSpaceSlotsd3fault0Slot4",
    "purchaseTimestamp": "1972",
    "startTimestamp": "1975",
    "purchasePrice": "0.005872"
  },
  "nextSlotOnDisplay": {
    "slotKey": "adSpaceSlotsd3fault0Slot2",
    "purchaseTimestamp": "1971",
    "startTimestamp": "1972",
    "purchasePrice": "0.001"
  },
  "currentSlotOnDisplay": {
    "slotKey": "adSpaceSlotsd3fault0Slot1",
    "purchaseTimestamp": "1970",
    "startTimestamp": "1971",
    "purchasePrice": "0.0017"
  }
}

All that is needed to calculate the current price && dropping-rate is minPrice, slotLengthHours, lastSlotFilledAkaPurchased, and of course the current time.

'current' is used to know which to display, and 'next' is used when the time comes so there won't be any contesting CAS-swap'ing the adSpaceSlotsd3fault0 document -- should there be a lot of purchases. This gives the swapping machine (who TODOreq, a cron job? ideallly any couchbase-client/wt-node would do this, and if the CAS-swap fails check to see that what we intended to do was in fact done by another neighbor node (there is also the RARE MAYBE IMPOSSIBLE 'two increments before we CAS-replace')) 24 hours to simply make 'next' -> 'current', and of course to fill in the next 'next' if one exists. Users of said document have to calculate for themselves whether to use current or next, depending on the current time.

The initial/minimum state of adSpaceSlotsd3fault0 is that only minPrice and slotLengthHours fields exist. There is also an 'early' state where only lastSlotFilledAkaPurchased and currentSlotOnDisplay exist (they would be identical): just after the first purchase, before the second.

The full json document for adSpaceSlotsd3fault0 before any purchases at all follows:

adSpaceSlotsd3fault0
{
  "minPrice": "0.001",
  "slotLengthHours": "24"
}

The full json document for adSpaceSlotsd3fault0 when no more 'next's have been purchased (the currentDisplayed becomes the lastPurchased):
The full json document for adSpaceSlotsd3fault0 after exactly 1 purchase follows:

adSpaceSlotsd3fault0
{
  "minPrice": "0.001",
  "slotLengthHours": "24",
  "lastSlotFilledAkaPurchased":
  {
      "slotKey": "adSpaceSlotsd3fault0Slot0",
      "purchaseTimestamp": "1969",
      "startTimestamp" : "1969",
      "purchasePrice": "0.001"
  },
  "currentSlotOnDisplay" :
  {
      "slotKey": "adSpaceSlotsd3fault0Slot0",
      "purchaseTimestamp": "1969",
      "startTimestamp" : "1969",
      "purchasePrice": "0.001"
  }
}

The full json document for adSpaceSlotsd3fault0Slot1 follows:

/A SLOT PURCHASE OF AN AD SPACE BEING SOLD
adSpaceSlotsd3fault0Slot1 //these are the keys/docs that are CAS-raced to (LCB_ADD)
{
  "purchaseTimestamp": "1970",
  "purchasePrice": "0.002",
  "slotFilledWith": "adSpaceSlotFillersJimboKnives0"	
}

adSpaceSlotFillersJimboKnives0 must be set up already by user JimboKnives. Once set up, it cannot be changed (they can/have-to make new ones)

The full json document for adSpaceSlotFillersJimboKnives0 follows:

//A SLOT FILLER WHICH IS USED TO PURCHASE AD SPACE
adSpaceSlotFillersJimboKnives0
{
  "username" : "JimboKnives",
  "hoverText": "You Know You Wanna Click!",
  "url": "http://buy-my-widget.com",
  "base64encodedImageData": "sdlfkjsdofuljkeworu"
}

the reason the doc has "username" so we can get to the 'profile' view below (can't parse up to that zero)

adSpaceSlotFillersJimboKnives should then list all of JimboKnives' ad campaigns (regardless of whether or not they have been used)

The full json document for adSpaceSlotFillersJimboKnives follows:

//A 'PROFILE' VIEW FOR A USER WHO BUYS AD SPACE (and their associated slot fillers)
adSpaceSlotFillersJimboKnives
{
  "adsCount": "2",
  "lastTenAds": [
    {
      "nickname": "Unused For Now",
      "adKey": "adSpaceSlotFillersJimboKnives1"
    },
    {
      "nickname": "Widgets For Sale Ad Campaign",
      "adKey": "adSpaceSlotFillersJimboKnives0"
    }
  ]
}

^if adsCount is > 10, they get linked to a "view" which shows all of them (it's assumed that the ads would show up in the view before 10 can be made). JimboKnives sees the nickname (which I suppose must be unique then) when selecting it as a slot filler for adSpaceSlotsd3fault0Slot1. When JimboKnives is logged in and clicks "buy" on abc.com/ads/buy-ad-space/d3fault/0 , we then load an expensive doc containing all of his ads: adSpaceAllSlotFillersJimboKnives

The full json document for adSpaceAllSlotFillersJimboKnives follows:

//ALL OF A USER'S POTENTIAL ADS FOR USE IN BUYING AD SPACE (only JimboKnives can get this doc when clicking "buy" on abc.com/ads/buy-ad-space/d3fault/0. Also perhaps if he is logged in and goes to "ALL". Non logged in users go to view, JimboKnives gets the expensive doc)
adSpaceAllSlotFillersJimboKnives
{
  "allSlotFillers": [
    {
      "nickname": "Widgets For Sale Ad Campaign",
      "slotFillerIndex": "0"
    },
    {
      "nickname": "Unused For Now",
      "slotFillerIndex": "1"
    }
  ]
}

^basically same as profile view, but the doc could get pretty big (TODOreq: ensure not > 20mb (lolol)) -- TODOoptimization: page'ination (guh)

//CRITICAL SESSION/ACCOUNT DATA FOR JimboKnives -- has ability to buy slot fillers
userJimboKnives
{
  "passwordHash": "MRGFtZyvcZU/2HdEW1H57bVtwfrPfw==",
  "passwordSalt": "1964Y1AFICvu1XiQE9w0xsPhDE8=",
  "balance": "0.098"
}

##
So before we allow JimboKnives to LCB_ADD adSpaceSlotsd3fault0Slot1, we first have to make sure he has enough funds. We also have to make sure he doesn't try to buy two things simultaneously (and doesn't have enough funds for both), so we have to 'lock' his userJimboKnives document by doing a CAS swap (if he tries to do two buys simultaneously, the second one will fail) and putting it into the following state while it is 'locked'

//CRITICAL SESSION/ACCOUNT DATA FOR JimboKnives -- buy abilities CAS-swap 'LOCKED' until transaction succeeds or fails (TODOreq: rollback/machine-failures)
userJimboKnives
{
  "passwordHash": "MRGFtZyvcZU/2HdEW1H57bVtwfrPfw==",
  "passwordSalt": "1964Y1AFICvu1XiQE9w0xsPhDE8=",
  "balance": "0.098",
  "slotToAttemptToFillAkaPurchase": "adSpaceSlotsd3fault0Slot1",
  "priceToAttemptToBuyItFor" : "0.002",
  "slotToAttemptToFillAkaPurchaseItWith" : "adSpaceSlotFillersJimboKnives0"
}

^priceToAttemptToBuyItFor is what the server side has calculated to be the current price after the user clicked "buy at current price" (clicking it gave us the slot # and the 'price they were seeing', but we disregard the 'price they were seeing' once we verify that currentPrice is less than or equal to 'price they were seeing'

^^priceToAttemptToBuyItFor must be >= balance otherwise we don't even do the CAS-swap lock (and definitely not the LCB_ADD of adSpaceSlotsd3fault0Slot1 of course)

##
if any of those 3 fields (slotTo, priceTo, slotTo) are seen, we know the account is locked. On login, we can also check whether or not adSpaceSlotsd3fault0Slot1 is-taken/filled/exists. If it isn't taken, we can 'recover' from a crashed server and proceed with trying to fill/purchase it. If it's taken by someone else, we unlock JimboKnives account without deducting priceToAttemptToBuyItFor from his balance. If on login we see adSpaceSlotsd3fault0Slot1 is taken by JimboKnives, then we've recovered from a crash-just-after-LCB_ADD, and we know that priceToAttemptToBuyItFor needs to still be deducted from his balance.
##
Then (whether 'recovering' or functioning as normal at this point), we CAS-swap 'UNLOCK' the account, deducting priceToAttemptToBuyItFor from the balance as we do. If the CAS-swap fails, we pull the key again and expect to see the "slotTo, priceTo, slotTo" gone... which means we thought we recovered from a fail, but actually another machine is still driving the transaction (maybe it's http front end just went down). 

NOPE: 
{

If the CAS-swap fails and the "slotTo,priceTo,slotTo" is still there, the entire system is fucked and we should emit an error and possibly shut everything down because wtf it should not (ALTHOUGH, maybe 'another' machine has finished the transaction and *gasp* started another one!?!?!? My brain just exploded)

}

##
If the CAS-swap fails and the "slotTo,priceTo,slotTo" is still there and the "slotToAttemptToFillAkaPurchase" is still the same it was before we attempted to CAS-swap-unlock it (adSpaceSlotsd3fault0Slot1), THEN shit is fucked and the entire system is fucked etc (like 'NOPE').
##
If however the CAS-swap fails and the "slotTo,priceTo,slotTo" is still there and the slotToAttemptToFillAkaPurchase is DIFFERENT, we know that they're logged in elsewhere and that that instance has already done the CAS-swap we are attempting to do (and it has ADDITIONALLY started another 'attempt to buy [something else]')
