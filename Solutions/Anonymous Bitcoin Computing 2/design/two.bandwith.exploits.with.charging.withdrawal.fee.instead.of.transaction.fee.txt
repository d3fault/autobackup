0) 0.00000001 min min price for ad campaign can be exploited by creating user, creating campaign, buying ad slot, then using the ~50 api hits of ~64kb. That's fucking cheap ass bandwidth (and I am giving it away at a loss).
1) 3% fee needs to be applied to transactions instead of withdrawals because users and ad campaigns are free to create and so the (whatever minimum) balance can be transferred from user/campaign to user/campaign freely/cheaply/INFINITELY and exploited as a bandwidth provider (easy to tack a file onto the end of an image). I'm glad at least that the math functions need simply be cut/pasted around and not much thinking is required. BTW this also future proofs for the "abc is a big company with many types of services. so many that in fact nobody ever has to withdraw" exploit
