I should figure out the maximum times a key can be queried per second on couchbase for my hardware (benchmark). I should then take "load average" (average hits per second accounting for all docs) and subtract that average from the maximum (to give us room to do other work). I should then take that (maximum-average) and divide it by the number of Wt nodes (those who do get-and-subscribe polling). I forget where I'm going with this but I can determine a better value than "100ms" to use as the polling interval on each Wt client, which I pulled out of my ass. 100ms might be too frequently for a 100 Wt pollers (10000 hits a second? then again... probably not... IDFK)
