A chart should actually be the main attraction, with the price rapidly dropping like I have it now down below (or on the "dot" following the "line" in said chart (as a tooltip type thing (except not just when hovering))). The javascript version would obviously be animated and it gives you a better sense of time. The main benefit of it, however, is that the javascript-less version still gives you the "it's dropping" feeling (whereas right now, a static number + explaination does not give you that feeling). The chart would bring the javascript/javascript-less versions ABOUT on par. Honestly I never thought of it before just now, while trying to think of ways to make the javascript shit easier to swallow (other ideas include: "random data points in between now and expire time, saying what price will be (ex: price in 5 mins, price tomorrow, price 5 mins before expire, blah)). Time to go see if Wt has any nifty chart functionality that I can erect in leik 2 leinz of coad.
