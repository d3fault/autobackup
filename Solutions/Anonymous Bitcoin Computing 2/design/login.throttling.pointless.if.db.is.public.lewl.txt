I was thinking about [re-]implementing login throttling for my impl, BUT since the ENTIRE fucking db is going to be public (torrent 'increments' most likely, otherwise I couldn't afford the bandwidth), login throttling becomes pointless: it would just be a DDOS point like any other point on the site. If they wanted to crack any of the passwords, they could download the db and do it on a local machine (MUCH faster) :-P. I am probably going to enable the captcha thing that Wt provides... so long as it doesn't get in my way (never used it before)... but meh that's not really relevant with the above.
