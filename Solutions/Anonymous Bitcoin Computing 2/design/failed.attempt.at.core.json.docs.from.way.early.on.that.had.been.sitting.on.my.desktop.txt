^accessible via: abc.com/buy-ad-space/d3fault/0 <-- even though i'm the one "selling" and it almost makes sense to list that in the url (especially when available to many), it makes more sense to tailor the URL to the action being done. listing a campaign for selling ad space would be in an "edit" profile mode, so maybe like abc.com/edit/sell-ad-space-campaigns/0 that of course -- err wait so wtf goes in abc.com/sell-ad-space ? i guess that. man i'm confus but this is stupid as fuck too
