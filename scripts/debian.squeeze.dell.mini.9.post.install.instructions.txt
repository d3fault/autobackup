Dell Mini 9 Fresh Debian Squeeze Install Instructions:

a) Add "contrib non-free" to every line in /etc/apt/sources.list -- also comment out the cdrom entry but this doesn't matter much. NOTE: adding "contrib" and "non-free" isn't strictly necessary. as of right now, the only package that requires non-free (i don't think any of them require contrib atm, i just add it for convenience) is my "unrar" package. p7zip-full can handle rar, as can unrar-free ... but i want the non-free one so i can open .rar files created with newer versions of winrar (3.0+, according to unrar-free's notes in apt-cache show). The point of that "NOTE", is that if I want a 100% "free" system, all I have to sacrifice (atm) is unrar. Big friggin whoop. Nice to know I'm right along the edge of a non-free system :-P
b) apt-get update
c) [TODOelaborate] - Remove un-used base packages. OpenOffice.org comes to mind..
d) Run that cleanAptEtc.sh script to remove unsused dependencies (we do this before the next line to save time/bandwidth/space. we don't want to upgrade packages that are about to be removed)
3) apt-get upgrade -y
c) [TODOelaborate] - Install packages from apt.initial.packages.debian.squeeze.devbox.txt , removing dev-specific stuff of course (ultimately I want a debian.squeeze.base.packages.txt , debian.squeeze.devbox.packages.txt , debian.squeeze.generic.online.packages.txt (un-used atm, but I'd use it on a desktop/online install of debian), and debian.squeeze.dell.mini.9.specific.packages.txt .... and some way to  of course automate the "gimmeh a deb line" or something. I could generate a script, or I could just run one. Stuff like dia/git/inkscape/mplayer goes in base, for example. valgrind goes in devbox. and whatever bcm43 dell mini 9 hardware supporting items to in the dellmini9 one. xul-ext-noscript etc would go in the generic online (even though my current devbox has them (so basically i am saying that it would be smart to specify the "apt packages on top of wheezy" required to compile an application on a per-application basis). I want to test witty with javascript disabled with ease)
