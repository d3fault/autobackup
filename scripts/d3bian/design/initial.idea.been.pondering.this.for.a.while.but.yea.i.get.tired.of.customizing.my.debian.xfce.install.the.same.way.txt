-install all packages
-edit '/usr/share/gvfs/mounts/network.mount', setting AutoMount to false
-edit '/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf', setting autologin-user=d3fault and autologin-user-timeout=0 (username should be dynamic? maybe just an ls of /home and error out if more than one dir?)
-create 'update/upgrade' script (taking into account jessie/sid 'install' upgrades)

INSTALL user:
-run everything once to get default configs created in home directory? everything = ??? need list i guess
-apply the patch. ez

CREATE user:
-run everything once to get default configs created in home directory? everything = ??? need list i guess
-git add/commit home directory
-config everything (need list (because recreating the script))
-git add/commit home directory again. the diff from the previous commit is what we want (and we discard everything from that first commit (useless))
