Yo dawg I heard you like to generate code so we put a code generator in your code generator so you can generate code while you generate code!


Or alternatively if you want to expand upon the previous version (which was written for just a single level code generator): Yo dawg I heard you like to code while you code so we put code in your code in your code so you can code while you code while you code.

^The orig in the single level code generator, for completeness' sake, was: Yo dawg I heard you like to code so we put code in your code so you can code while you code!

And obligatory original meme reference I saw on teh internets: Yo dawg I heard you like to drive so we put a car in your car so you can drive while you drive.


Best part is I am actually generating code generators :-D (well in my head I am, right now the app does jack shit). SMOKE WEED EVERY DAY! Hi Mom! Or mb I should say Hi Nick since he's the only person I know (IRL) that will understand CodeGeneratorGenerator/src and this doc.
