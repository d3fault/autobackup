CodeGeneratorGenerator

As input, I take a directory of source code files (RequestResponseContracts2 will suffice).
Output is a code generator which queries the user for the "list of symbolNames to do str.replace for".


Some prefix.

SomeBusinessClass
someSlot (instruct user(s!!!) to use uppercase first letter for classes and lowercase first letter for methods)

Another prefix.

AnotherBusinessClass
anotherSlot


If any of the "another" prefixes are now found in the CodeGeneratorGenerator input,

SCRATCH THAT there is no "Another prefix".

wait fuk this project is fuk'd my brain jus exploded idk if this is doable anymore.
