^^^^Then, BEFORE we overwrite/truncate the glue _files_ on a re-gen, we VERIFY that the file has NOT been modified and then do NOT overwrite (at least not initially. a later version could prompt) if it HAS been modified.

we only write (truncating on open) if the file does not exist or if it exists but has not been modified. those are the only 2 conditions in which we write the AutoGenerated glue code _FILES_. emphasis is on 'files' because shit man this would potentially be writing files in the middle of your massive [monolithic] git repo. in fact if I _knew_ I could safely do that, it'd make the tool much more useful. writing only during those 2 conditions sounds safe as fuck (ESPECIALLY once QIODevice::CreateOnly flag gets implemented to mimic QTemporaryFile's guarantee (from the OS) to have been the one to CreatedAndOpened the file. man why the fuck isn't it in there yet? I thought about coding (and contributing) it a while ago, maybe I should now :-/
