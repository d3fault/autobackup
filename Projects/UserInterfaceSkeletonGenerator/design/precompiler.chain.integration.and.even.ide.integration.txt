I'm aware that this could be done as a stage of compilation.
I think IDE integration (you specify which classes to "watch" for changes to regen the interface), and yea ultimately you'd .gitignore the interface (but not the IMPLs) since it can be regenerated from the business class. mb done during ./configure stage then? w/e w/e fuck it I'm getting way too far ahead of myself...
