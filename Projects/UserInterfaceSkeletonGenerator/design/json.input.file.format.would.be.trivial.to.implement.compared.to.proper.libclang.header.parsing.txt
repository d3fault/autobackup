I should write a Qt CLI app that lets me pass in text (stdin or file, stdin only initially), in this case the "raw lines of c++" needed to _use_ the UserInterfaceGenerator app itself. take that and patch it (using 2 halves of the userinterfacegenerator source-that-needs-patchin, putting the text received in the middle), then compile and run UserInterfaceGenerator. of course I could just use some json format, because keys are safer (from regressions later) than positional arguments. actually either solution doesn't sound too hard, and the json route would give me much better runtime performance (until computers get so fast that compiling code takes a negligible amount of time). fuck splitting some source file in half that sounds spooky as fuck, for multiple reasons I don't even want to get into. json route sounds trivial and psbly buys us better forwards and/or backwards compatibility
