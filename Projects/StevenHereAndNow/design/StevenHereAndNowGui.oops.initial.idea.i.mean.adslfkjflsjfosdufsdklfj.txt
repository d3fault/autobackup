Oceans are atom splitters. (My crude understanding of physics aside). Most rocks in space are... derp rock. Even those with volcanos only (like ours in the past) are mostly rock. Water takes rock and splits it into really fine pieces and distributes it all over the planet. This splitting is the building block of evolution.


Arguably, though, the volcanos made the water and are therefore the building block of evolution, and ultimately you'd also be able to say "the laws of physics are the building block of evolution", and every one of your statements would be correct. We are inheriters of the class interface "ILawsOfPhysics". Each step in evolution (including "volcano" and "water") are a class derived from that base ILawsOfPhysics _TYPE_. We probably are trillions of abstract classes (Steven being the class with the trillion long public inheritence thing (class Steven : public EvolvedApe)). I say Steven because I am specific (not because I'm special). There is no ACTUAL "human person" that is the "most human", but there is conceptually and in a way we humans accept (o rite because it's just a logical(sic) usage of it)
