//Shit the laws of physics can be understood, but then I'd have a circular depdendency
//We are just a perspective (which can be understood) of a series/stream of concepts (which can be understood), one of which is the laws of physics (which can also be understood)
//So really, I think therefore I am is as good as it gets :). It is the abstract base of perspective, concepts, and the laws of physics
//But still, I understand myself, therefore I need to be able to put myself on that stream of concepts. Is it possible to observe the concept and to be the observed concept at the same time? I mean obvioiusly in real life it is because I'm doing it right now :-D, but I mean in the strict object oriented C++ sense, just not sure it will compile :(
//We are not "a perspective", we haveA perspective ;-)
//we do stream a series of concepts (but that base type is 'can be understood', and usually isn't)
//We can stream a concept of ourselves through our concept stream processor (mindfuck, because isn't that one of my bases technically?)
//We have a sequential list of events that have happened to us (regardless of whether or not we are conscious beings and able to understand those events, they still happen to us and our "properties of our existence in space and time)
//X,Y,Z
//The concept of Time, though it isn't strictly a "Steven" property, my perspective of it might be or something or other idfk tbh
