i hate that i'm lost in this code so often... but i keep moving forward because i know/hope that it will be the last time i ever need to code an app without designing it. i wish i could design this first, but then i know i'd never code it.
i can't design -> code it
but i can code -> redesign/remake(re-code) it.
if i designed what i'm doing now, it'd be design -> code -> redesign
two levels of designing, fuck that shit... but it'd probably make it easier to understand. i'm a bit lost..
