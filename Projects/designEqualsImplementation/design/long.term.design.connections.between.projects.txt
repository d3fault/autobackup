connections can be made between multiple classes, i see no reason (aside from needing to re-arrange the gui for tabs to "pop out" (firefox etc) that i couldn't connect two projects together (to form a larger project? or solution in VS lingo) a click-release just checks with the project to see if there's a mouseDown in another project and if so, connects to the two projects (what it connects is specified somewhere obviously). automating the use of projects etc... "using them as libraries", whatever idfk. my current tab-based method doesn't allow for it, unless i let them pop-out or interact with other application instances? or do a tile mode view, etc etc
