maybe like a million keyfiles, only one of which is real.

when doing an "account recovery" (aka login on new system (without cache of any kind)), you brute force your million keyfiles and then remember which one works (as well as save it)

1million * sizeof(keyfile)
1000000*64bytes = 64mb

so each new account appends a minimum of 64mb to the network
7billion*64mb = 448,000,000,000,000,000 bytes for every human currently on earth (est)
which is..
eh...
(adds commas)
448 billion mb
448 million gb
448 thousand tb
448 petabytes? not sure if my math is correct
DO-ABLE... but very wasteful....
also very secure (given secure passwords)
takes a million times longer (theoretically) to crack. my math is most certainly wrong here, but on average 1 million/2 times longer (fluctuates). my math is definitely right here.
