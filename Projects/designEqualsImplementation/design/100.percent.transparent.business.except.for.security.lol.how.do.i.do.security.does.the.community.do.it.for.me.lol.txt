i should have a 100% transparent business where i have a utility for anyone to provide me disk space/bandwidth and be paid for it (bitcoin)
i would control the core, but only because i can't figure out how to securely do it on a dht (if it's even possible)
it's even harder to do it + get money for doing it on a dht...
i pay the disk space/bandwidth providers with money earned from selling/advertising the applications. a cut for selling, and fees for advertising amongst other selling app.
there is also security to consider
lol such an understatement
i'm pretty much going to be paid for doing security. i can outsource it.. but that makes no sense
outsourcing + security is a contradiction really
