When connecting two objects to communicate with each other in the design, the user shouldn't care if one side is "block/message" mode and the other is "stream" mode. This should also account for using old C/C++ libraries (that weren't created in designEquals itself). I am essentially saying that a trivial wrapper can be made to go in between the two kinds. In designEquals itself, the user should not need to give a shit about what kind is what. There might be a logical error in this however and it might be impossible. Still, I think most streams/messages APIs can be wrapped transparently (using [transparent] buffering if needed).
