eh
user code segments
probably loops and whatnot
but i want as much functionality as possible to exist as "lifeline nodes"
user segment is lifeline node
connection call is lifeline node
i want to define as many lifeline node types as possible so that user code segments aren't used as often as possible
hell, even 'loops and whatnot' could probably be lifeline nodes, with the body of the loop being a user segment code (as in, they type shit. but i guess the body of the while loop lifeline node could also contain more lifeline nodes???)
i need to look at my guiBackendGenerator code and see where to go from here
