the return type is merely a string that the recipient signals back to another auto-generated slot, where we pick up execution (if it's all done synchronous)

'use 1 thread per back-end'
'use 1 thread per class per back-end'

it could just be the case that they are just designated to be on different threads, therefore the Qt::AutoConnection must be used at all times.

for a connection-call with a return type,
the call is self->receiver
at least, that's what it looks like to YOU. it is all you have to create. a method with an argument.
the generator creates my signal, the receivers slot, and also (FOR THE RETURN VAL) the receiver's signal and my slot where execution continues
