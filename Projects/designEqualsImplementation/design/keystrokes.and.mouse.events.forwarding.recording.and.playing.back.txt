what if i send my keyboard strokes to my online computer over the network (configure adapter to be write-only?) but they can only be read/UTILIZED (synergy style) and also allow other users to read on the online/uploaded copy (that machine's sole purpose)
same with mouse events
all are sent, only if a) want to control online comp or b) want to share offline screen with online world (or combination thereof (gaming etc idgaf bout security))
