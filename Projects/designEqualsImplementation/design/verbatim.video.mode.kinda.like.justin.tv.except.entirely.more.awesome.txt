so for my verbatim show thing, video... if i decide to put ads on it, compress the framerate to account for like 4x 15 second clips throughout the day...
the client mode of that software... that anyone can use... let's the USER configure how many segments, how long they are, etc. they can preview the video framerate when deciding, to make sure it's not too fast lawl
WHATEVER they choose, they get 51% of the ad revenue, i get 49%

loophole: they don't use the built in ads, but instead hire their own people
so i'm hosting their videos and they make 100% revenue

a "report 3rd party advertising in this video" feature would be handy
i leave the videos untouched (i'm way against censorship), but i insert text ads so i make a slice. don't ask permission, just do

videos without ads, 1st or 3rd party, are hosted for free. youtubes style before it got all shitty (hover ads are THE WORST)

3rd party advertising videos that embed their videos get around my loophole plug though... so hover ads do solve that problem.

fuck this shit anyways, the app market is where it's at...
ads shown in there also have 51%/49% split

revenue from sales is 95% them, 5% me

open source = no ads, no money, etc

open source 3rd party ads = i insert text ads, take 100% profit. i can't help but think 3rd party ads might kill me
but i HATE censorship
censor their right to use 3rd party ads? nawwwwwwwwwwww
