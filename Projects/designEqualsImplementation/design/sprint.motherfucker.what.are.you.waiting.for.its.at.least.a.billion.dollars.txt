nokia has no idea what they're sitting on
someone just needs to take advantage of the market
i need to be first to market
i need to speed the fuck up
someone's going to claim the private/encrypted/host-proof-hosted timeline recorded social media application (exe, accessible read-only through web (ad supported on web ONLY)) that is lgpl inline editable (talk to lawyer about this, but release it first) by the general public (they agree their submission is lgpl (that agreement is only to a specific pseudonym whose IP address is not recorded, only his public decryption key is (this works WAY better on a dht than on a private network))) and can generate standalone/inline-editable (either or both or neither(plugin mode is neither?)) applications by designing a simple UML app. you design the logic of the application there. front-end is auto-generated but definitely still editable/customizable/overrideable(from the default).

to nokia exec: how about i buy you (wink wink). it's a better idea. in money terms they are still buying me and retaining control of all their shit. i still retain all my free will and power to do whatever i want though. in a sense, they bum off my image instead of buying me out.
