right click node -> edit
vs
draw an arrow from node to another node

basically, how do i add functionality to a class?

keeping in mind user segments too, which only seem appropriate by right-clicking. or at the very least, it's true that they only involve one node.


connection-call seems more intuitive to create/make by using arrows
user segment seems more intuitive to create/make by using a context menu
the ordering of them, where their added, the order they appear, needs to be taken into account
should also be able to change the ordering later on
