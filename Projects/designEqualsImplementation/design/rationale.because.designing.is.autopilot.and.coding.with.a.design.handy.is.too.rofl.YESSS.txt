designEquals rationale:

When designing in dia, I consider my brain to be on auto-pilot. Understanding the project as a whole is DRASTICALLY easier.

When coding/implementing a design, you just refer to the design over and over and over and it's pretty fucking easy. It is also auto pilot... though it's a lot more tedious and time consuming

not related to rationale:
Trying to change your design in the middle of coding is a fucking nightmare. I mean, in your brain. If you don't HAVE a design. Coding without a design will almost always lead to a giant fucking headache

re: path to launch
...all the bits are in place in my brain (design), now it's just time to write them down (code)...






so fucking pumped.
