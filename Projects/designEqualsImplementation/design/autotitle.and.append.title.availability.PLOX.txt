i keep forgetting intros to typings while saving and typing in the title. i want auto-title like the old google docs used to have. [untitled] = "first sentence/line (depending on a max characters)
you can still put a title in later (the date you put in the title is recorded(?? or not? i guess it MUST since it's a separate tangent for you later on. it's just backtracking to a different tangent and appending to it. the timeline shows a non-connected blip because that tangent modified was not related to say the video being streamed watching me do it (me or my screen or both (stitched)? been thinking a lot about this lately)... or the typing in a text document.
