donate, invest (just a fixed/variable(?) percent return), advertise (both ends), buy/sell software, dev support


also paying someone to make a design/application (they are one in the same ;-)) like on those "freelance" sites

i couuld do ALL of those under 1 company
or split them all up so it looks like there's competition

separation of power, separation of blame, separation of moneys... hmmm....

if all these combine don't make me a billionaire, well shit.
saying it will make me a millionaire is a gross understatement.
