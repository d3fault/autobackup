even though i'm putting the dht on hold, i still want my privately hosted (though host-proof-hosted!) system to rely on a filesystem/database that mimics what the dht will be
this will future proof code as well as the data, allowing both to be transferred to the dht when it is stable

basically, no deletions allowed. there should be a separate entity.. maybe even a separate company(?).. for handling raw file storage
any file that hits that is already encrypted, and no [unencrypted] keys ever touch that server. (encrypted keys inside wallets of course do)
