free lgpl releases on the "market" do not have advertisements on them.
purchase ones do (each others + 3rd party ads (i guess i should become an ad space (this wording is similar to google's copyrighted bullshit, but is not it) exchanger too? am i going to allow 3rd party advertising agencies such as google/yahoo/microsoft to  put ads up? no.))
