"method call"
vs
"event handler"

eh...



i need to be able to define a method on a node
call it via a connection
but i also need to be able to define the CONTENTS of said method...


and how would i do

if(boolean)
  connectionCall();

aside from defining a method whose sole purpose is to make a connection call
but then i'm still putting the contents of the method in the method via design

the method is designed
it's contents are designed

no 'user segment code'
but HOW?


another important thing
say a user makes a connection call from a user segment
i don't think it'd be very easy to get the arrow to show up in the design... and where would i put it? coming FROM the user segment? what if there are multiple? it is possible but complicates things

i'm losing confidence in myself and this project
maybe it's just too damn big for a first project...
