In the top left, there's a small link/button/whatever: "First Video",
but right smack dab in the middle is the live stream.

I need to re-launch right after I have StandUp button coded. Then just hike (so pack a few days worth of food before, and plan the route to have internets). I should probably leave the camper in storage, since it's a live stream and that would make leaving it parked alone outside would be extremely stupid. Then a few days later go back to living in camper.


There's actually a boatload of coding that needs to be done to support this, especially if I want to be wearing wasdf when it occurs (I do). I mean multiple subprojects!!! I don't even know how I'll present the video, mb hls.

I should definitely not use the same capture card that I used durnig the first launch (assuming I use a capture card at all (xD might just risk it fml)). but I think that should only be initially. after some time I should migrate back to the [more secure] capture card method. it's just that 1080p capture cards are hard to find (because anti-piracy schmucks hav intentionally made it that way (I'm getting fucked as a side effect of their anti-piracy actions, I don't even plan on comiitting copyright infringement!)). fuck copyrights anyways (so probably fuck you).


I want my life to consist of 3 things:
a) DDRace
b) Code
c) Hike

and I want to live stream all 3. I am going to live stream all 3.


that "synergy" app, I may need to modify it so that I can CODE _and_ DDRace at the same fucking time (on 2 screens, connected via synergy). actually modifying synergy to emit some signal (system signal or some lib's signal, there will definitely be something I can use/CREATE-IF-NECESSARY) to tell a different app (the video feed switcher) to do it's thang (switch video feeds.....(to whichever screen the MOUSE is on (because that's how synergy works))). we also tell MouseOrMotionOrMySexyFaceOrTheBeautifulWorldVideoMaker to watch for "motion" only on the screen that the mouse is currently "pointing at" (in synergy lingo/terms). it should be impossible to have motion (generated by YOU i realtime) on the screen that your synergy-mouse is NOT pointing at, so watching for motion on that should not happen. UNLESS, you enable some option (that should be implemented LATER) to watch "both" or "all" screens (because hey, maybe you DO want to switch [the video feed] to popups/etc on the other screen(s).
^IMPLEMENT LATER. ALT+TAB 4 NOW (but still do the D3faultNetLiveVideoStreamVideoFeedSwitcher abstraction described below, since it's easy/beneficial).

MouseOrMotionOrMySexyFaceOrTheBeautifulWorldVideoMaker should feed into VideoFeedSwitcher (note: "standUp" is prioritized above MouseOrMotionOrMySexyFaceOrTheBeautifulWorld. Maybe that means I should move it to the front of that beast of a project name? TheBeautifulWorldOrMouseOrMotionOrMySexyFace_VideoMaker. Yes actually that describes it much more accurately. this app CONTROLS VideoFeedSwitcher as on primary basis, and Synergy ALSO CONTROLS VideoFeedSwitcher on a secondary basis (when not standUp). VideoFeedSwitcher needs to be dumb though: "select this video feed, seleect that video feed"; it should not contain any "business logic" for all this OTHER shit I'm describing. So I need a D3faultNetLiveVideoStreamVideoFeedSwitcher to contain my "specific" business logic, and then D3faultNetLiveVideoStreamVideoFeedSwitcher is the only one that talks to VideoFeedSwitcher. TheBeautifulWorldOrMouseOrMotionOrMySexyFace_VideoMaker and the SynergyWrapper do not control VideoFeedSwitcher directly, but they report their "events" (signals) to D3faultNetLiveVideoStreamVideoFeedSwitcher and then the fuckin magic happens man if you don't get it by now you're fucked.


TheBeautifulWorldOrMouseOrMotionOrMySexyFace_VideoMaker (nvm, read the doc file lskfjklsdjfdsoufljewroudslfkjsdofusdlfkjdslkj.txt) is the first main app that I create/use to re-launch, but eventually I could convert it into a "plugin" of some ultimate "timeline" app I do want to eventually (but not yet!) make. The way I code already (properly) would make it trivial to convert to a "plugin" later, I think (but not 1000% sure).
