since we keep all mutations, old snapshots can be deleted to save space (but should they be since they are a part of the file (or maybe they should be in their own file for that very reason idfk). or maybe we drop the unwanted snapshots on file rewrites which only happen as we paxos agree to change the partition map (such as when adding precision to our filenames using the lhs of the sha1 on character at a time, or when a node is added/removed (but idk if i should take the network down for (paxos) a fault andor rejoin, probably not but it may be necessary idfk. and just because a node is added/removed doesn't mean MY partition has changed, so we only delete when it is right to do so))). we should probably keep a few snapshots around though just in case. TODOreq: periodically test that you can build the latest revision of the object (which is normally attained by getting the snapshots and then applying all mutations after it) by ONLY using "all the mutations". it is an integrity check/test (of the mutation/revision functionality/code/etc itself), but should only be done periodically as it is quite expensive. it can/should probably be done during the data-integrity-verification (bit rot detection, ETC), since it has to be read for that check anyways!
