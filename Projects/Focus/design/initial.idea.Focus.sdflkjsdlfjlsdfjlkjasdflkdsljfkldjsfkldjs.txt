In an app which is a todo list processor or perhaps elegantly named "Focus", creating a "tangent" (new idea/thing/todo-list-item) should reference the "current todo list item" or "current idea" or whatever: the new item is, or was, spawned from the "current" idea/todo-list-item, so making note of it is extremely useful! but the point is that after you write down the tangent idea/todo-list-entry, you fucking resume your orig train of thought!
