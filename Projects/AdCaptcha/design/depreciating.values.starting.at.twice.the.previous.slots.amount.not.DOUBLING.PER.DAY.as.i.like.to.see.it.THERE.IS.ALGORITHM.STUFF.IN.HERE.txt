i think i've mentioned this before but i want to mention it again just in case
depreciating values
doubles each day... depreciates back down to it's old value (the day before) linearly throughout the day
maybe 1 minute intervals

the page where users can watch values drop is NOT server synchronized
that is, the server does not have to PUSH each notification every minute telling it about the drop
on page load, the server gives them the "now" price and 100% on client-side using custom javascript, the values depreciate
HOWEVER, when the unit is sold (and therefore no longer available for purchase), THEN a server-intiated update is sent and the unit is no longer buy-able... rather, it is... but for the next day's price


so the price is 100% determined by how far it is away from now
it has nothing to do with doubling the day before it
if nobody buys it, there's a possibility that that day can go for cheaper than the day before it (eventually.. after 24 hours)

say a friday/saturday is more valuable than a sunday

today's wednesday at noon and (just pulling this out of my ass) friday sells for $5 right at noon
right then, saturday opens up at $10 and over the course of the next 24 hours, linearly depreciates to $5.
if after that initial 24 hours it is not purchased, it then linearly depreciates down to $1 (or whatever i put as MINIMUM_BID) right at the stroke of midnight saturday night/sunday morning
for simplicity, i could just make it do the second depreciating function only
should*

so is the next day (monday) $20 or is it sundayActual*2 ??????
HMMMMMM
kinda makes more sense to do sunday*2
for every day, really...



let's think this through

$1 minimum bid... stays here indefinitely until the moment someone buys it (they get 24 hours from when they buy it. fuck "midnight" etc)
say monday at noon someone buys the $1 slot... immediately the $2 slot is opened and it linearly depreciates back down to $1 (the minimum... NOT the previous days price.. though coincidentally IS for this second slot) over the next 24 hours
assuming nobody purchases, we are back where we were to begin with, $1. perfect.

say monday at like 6pm someone buys the next 24 hour slot (to start tuesday at noon) for $1.75
immediately the 3rd 24 hour slot becomes available for $3.50 ((n-1)*2), and it begins it's linear depreciation down to $1
except with that slot, it isn't 24 hours we have to wait... like we cleanly have with the 2nd 24 hour slot depreciating
so it linearly depreciates from $3.50 ((n-1)*2) to $1 over the course of monday 6pm to wednesday at noon (the END of the second slot)

***********************************************************
nextPrice = previousPrice*2
depreciatingTime = previousSlot.EndTime - currentTime
***********************************************************

^^using those 2 numbers i can use math to make it linearly depreciate back down to $1 right when the last purchased slot opens up. the idea is that it will be re-purchased before it gets to that. it will, in most cases... unless the site sucks lol...
$1 minimum is just to make the math easier... but it can be $0.01 for all i care... or even lower. ARBITRARY
(in fact $1 will probably be much to high for most sites... so it'd probably be best to make the minimum $0.01.... though on the other hand, maybe it should be specifiable per-site (ok now this is just getting ahead of myself) because a lot of sites would scoff at the idea of letting a day of advertising go for $0.01... or even $1...)

yes, site-specifiable is definitely the best way to go... $1 is my suggested default... it doubles quickly enough imo...
