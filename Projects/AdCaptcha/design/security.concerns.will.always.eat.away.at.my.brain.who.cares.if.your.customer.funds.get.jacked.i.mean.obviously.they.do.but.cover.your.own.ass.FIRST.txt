i can't think of a scenario where the webserver for adcaptcha being compromised does not also allow them to empty out every user's account
the ONLY additional security feature is that i can keep them from taking _MY_ 1%...
...my slice of the action (5%? "m_Percentage")

since the server is where everything happens, compromising it means they can make up whatever they want to happen
they can send requests for balance transfers, which are not denied if there is sufficient funds... and they can send commands to pay out to whomever they please (themselves obviously)
i can/will/should limit them so they cannot take my percent. even though i am putting my users at risk, it is better than also being at risk myself
there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY IN HELL to fix this except hosting the server with physical security as well
even then, exploitation is still a factor... but it's a factor for the bitcoin server too... which is why i will of course forward all of my 1% slice to bitcoin addresses with an air gap
the best they could do is overwrite my address queue with addresses of their own and take my daily payout(s) until i discover it and fix it
they cannot rob me of previous days


i'm starting to think maybe it would be unwise to host a financial application remotely
but eh,.. need to handle traffic.
man i can't believe this is my solution
AdCaptcha, what a crock of shit
what a piece of shit
an advertising agency
god i fucking fail
