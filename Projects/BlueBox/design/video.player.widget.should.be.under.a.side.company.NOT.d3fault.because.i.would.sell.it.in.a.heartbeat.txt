i'm thinking i should release the GPL/LGPL (whatever i decide) + commercial VIDEO DECODER/PLAYER WIDGET product under a false/side-company
i just don't want to tie it to d3fault because
a) it's shit compared to what i have planned for d3fault
b) i would sell it in a heartbeat for a few million bux and don't want to lose my d3fault branding for good over something so small


nokia might be interested
i could release it GPL/commercial initially, then probe nokia to buy me out... who can then release it under LGPL/commercial
it can be a part of Qt just like Qt/Webkit
it can be Qt/VideoPlayerWidget or something
i guess Qt/LibAV but i'm providing more functionality than what libav provides alone

the only thing is, how do you convert the contributed GPL code to LGPL later on?
how the fuck did Qt do it? did Trolltech just ignore everybody's commits in the early days???
i think this is worth asking on the qt mailing list. nobody would know wtf/why i'm asking, but it'd be an interesting history lesson
