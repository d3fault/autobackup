for the "plugins" (where ads will show), on the page that is:
a) download page for regular browser users (plugin binary, plugin source.. view source links)
b) install page for autoplugin (bluebox, examplePluginApp)
c) update page for autoplugin (...)

the detection of which of the 3 modes to be in should not be determined via user agent as previously mentioned
the ads might eventually filter out my "autoplugin" user agent
i need to always mimic the latest firefox. or i guess just regular webkit is probably fine.

ANYWAYS, the detection is done via POST variables
javascript can probably see the GET variables
only the server sees the POST variables

so like check4update=1&version=0.0.1
or: install=1
none = browser mode, offer zip/dll/source/view-source/whatever
