i can also provide updates without having to worry about going anonymous etc
i am updating only the legal code
bluebox autodetects the update and pulls it in
once bluebox is published/stable, it keeps itself up to date (well, the plugins at least. i doubt i'll need to update bluebox very often)

i should still use keys to verify authenticity etc...
