each individual plugin page can/should do basic user agent switching
if(pluginLoaderUserAgent)
{
  proto = 'plugin'
}
else
{
  proto = 'http'
}

when using the plugin proto, it is still fetched via http. it is only done so by our application and then processed specially afterwards
the binary is hosted on google code or sourceforge or someshit. i only host the ads, the summary, the url, the the php useragent switch
