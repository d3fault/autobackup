incentive to put up links

icefilms gesture
megaupload gesture

incentive to vote/rate accurately


incentive to put up links: they get to put up a page displayed during the 60 seconds for an ad hit
icefilms gesture: always show frame below with icefilms front page (ads take care of themselves)
megaupload gesture: parse out the popup url, put it in a frame too. maybe ice and mega are side by side (but below)

incentive to vote/rate accurately: if accuracy > 98% && voteCount > someNum (50 or so?), hmmm... what? let them show ads too? rofl this is hilarious. can't figure out WHERE i'd let them show an ad. this is not fully thought out, the the others are.


so a grid: top-left = my page, 1 ad hit per view, top-right = poster's ad (OR MINE TAKES COLSPAN=2 if we use an icefilms link)

err
no

it's icefilms or poster's page
not both
because once we have posters, we won't need icefilms at all.
if the page is parsed from icefilms, THEN we show the icefilms front page

TOP = mine always. you can only even see MINE. fuck their ads. we want impressions, but don't really want to even show the page..
bottom-left = link poster or icefilms
bottom-right = megaupload (or i guess 2 shared) popup ad


the megaplugin needs an excuse to parse out the ad
i guess it could provide a "fullSource()" method that returns the source and bluebox parses it manually/hacky/whogivesafuck

megaupload won't disable abilities because they want to continue to receive ad hits
same with icefilms

they fuck with me, their ads are no longer shown.

maybe even another optional gesture: a link to sign up for megaupload premium. but fuck that, i might as well make a download service if i expect moneys from it. the whole goal is FREE.
