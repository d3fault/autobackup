bluebox
qt 5 services
every piece of functionality split up

icefilms parser
megaupload parser
video decoder
video player
(ok maybe video decoder and player are just one, for simplicity's sake)

BlueBox is just a script basically

each module/SERVICE (qt 5 specific) is on it's own d3fault subdomain

bluebox is anon/tor/etc

anyways, the webpages on teh subdomains are special
during the installation process of bluebox, webview's are used to display the subdomains on the 'install' page
the install page has a special protocol that only bluebox understands (well, others definitely can too. the api should be public)

basically, bluebox is the only 'illegal' script and i get ad hits basically like 4 fucking times (one per module) during the bluebox install
also for every time i need to update icefilms/megaupload scripts

during bluebox install, each plugin subdomain is a "click next to install [module]" thing
i should try to make it NOT look like a website, but a fluid application.
the pages of course have google ads on them.

there is of course a "download source" and "download dll" (without using the special "protocol") on the page for whenever someone goes to the page in a regular browser
those 2 links should be smaller compared to the proto "click next to install"

maybe in bluebox, it walks you through the steps during install
'ok, now we're installing the megaupload parser. please click Install Megaupload Parser below'

<a href='myproto://pluginInstallurl'>Install Megaupload Parser</a>
[/webview]



my whole '60 seconds video ad' service was flawed because i'd have to launder the money
this one is badass like in your fucking face mpaa/riaa (well, not r) go fucking kill yourselves

icefilms parser not illegal
megaupload parser not illegal
video decoder/player not illegal

"connecting the dots between the 3" = illegal
that's why bluebox is hosted anon/tor
anon = bitcoin paid for/proxy-registered/fake-name-etc http site
tor = same shit. they reference each other of course

bluebox is simply a plugin download + keeper up to dater

LGPL for everything, including bluebox. fuck the police.


i just wonder how stable qt 5 is...
