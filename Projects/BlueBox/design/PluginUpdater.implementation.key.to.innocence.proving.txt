m_PluginUpdater = the [default implementation of an example usage of the bulk plugins updater page] WIDGET. basically the main widget for that page
is a QVBoxLayout (on the m_PluginUpdater Widget) with IOWidgets (IWidgets = {movie title for iceparser (actually this is both I and O since i want it to be an auto-suggest), url for video player/downloader}, OWidgets = a megaupload link from iceparser)
the default implementation just loads all plugins in a folder which can be specified
the default folder name is "shitplugins"


signal PluginUpdater::isUpToDate()
signal PluginUpdater::reloadModuleRequired(module) //we do an update. the module should be completely unloaded from us by now
signal PluginUpdater::updated(module) //we get this call when we install for the first time and after we update/reload
