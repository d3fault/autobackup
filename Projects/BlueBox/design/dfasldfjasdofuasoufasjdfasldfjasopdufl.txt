basically i need to design a system so that users can view movies easily, but mpaa/riaa bots would have a hard time parsing my db. each view requires a captcha (which, as i just mentioned, will also contain an ad). this will slow down the mpaa/riaa dmca notices.. they can't auto-send them out or auto harvest them

however

i'm not sure if the captcha should be presented to the user at the blob data phase or what
eh, this is all long term shit that incorporates user-reuploading etc
for now just parsing icefilms is really plenty...
don't need captcha or ad...
but i will put ad in update page


a user uploading a movie has no idea what he's uploading
he does not have the decryption key
he is assigned a blob and told to mirror it
simple as that

"BlueBox Regular Edition" (...)
"BlueBox Hacker Edition" (tor configured (for db communication only), auto-uploading/mirroring accross various file sharing sites, meritocratic rating system for integrity delivered content (NUKE'd etc))
