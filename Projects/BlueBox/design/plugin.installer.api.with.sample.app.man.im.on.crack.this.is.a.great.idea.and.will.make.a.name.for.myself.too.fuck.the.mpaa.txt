bluebox chains specific services, but it uses an api to do so. the install protocol uses this api
i need to publish a sample/spec app that also uses said protocol
that sample app will be worthless by itself.
you install icefilms parser, it gives you the megaupload link
you install megaupload parser, it gives you the extracted download link + wait time
you install video decoder/player, it asks you for a file input. maybe there's another plugin called "fileLoader" that just loads a file into memory... so we're at the same spot as where bluebox would be

very obviously stupid, but a) serves as an example of the published api and b) provides a reason for the api to exist... or should i say, a reason for the plugins to support/use/be-released-under said protocol

plugins.d3fault.net is parsed by the "example" app and the user is shown a list of plugins
maybe each plugin should be on a subdomain of plugins
iceparser.plugins.d3fault.net
megaparser.plugins.d3fault.net
fileloader.plugins.d3fault.net
videoplayer.plugins.d3fault.net

file loader is a worthless piece of shit, installing it by itself gives you a pointer to the first few bytes, as well as exposing a 'getMore' method or some bullshit. getMore reads more bytes from hdd and loads it into memory...
