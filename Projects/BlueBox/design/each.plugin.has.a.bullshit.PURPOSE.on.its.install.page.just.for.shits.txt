each plugin should also have a Purpose on the same page where you download/install

Purposes
iceparser: If you're too lazy to browse icefilms, this plugin will search for a given tv show/movie for you
megaparser: If you're too lazy to wait the 60 seconds and click the button (often bringing a popup), this plugin shows you the parsed url after the countdown runs out
etc

kinda like a legal thing that my defense lawyer points to: "this is the purpose of each plugin. clearly NOT copyright infringement conspiracy"
