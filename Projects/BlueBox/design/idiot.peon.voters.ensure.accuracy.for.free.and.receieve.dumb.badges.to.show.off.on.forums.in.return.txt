incentive for people to vote accurately
they have to cast at least 50 votes with > 99% accuracy
all they get is a rating and a badge or some dumbshit. i don't think i can get them any money
i don't know where i'd put their ads...

there should be a discussion forum etc where people can chat n shit and show off their stupid badges
idiot peons will do it for free and eat it right up
