OSIOS: Operating System Independent Operating System
*BSD, *nix, Windows, and Android all suck, so I decided to write my own "operating system" that runs on top of each of those, relying heavily on Qt (or other external libs where appropriate) to do the heavy lifting.


p.s. OpenBSD is pro as fuck and perfect FOR ME and other enthusiests (which is why it will be my primary target base), but not easy enough for yes/no junkies
