what should i focus on for the time being? reading or writing?
craigslist poster helper is mainly writing...
...forclosure reader (remax excel) is mainly reading
(connecting the two is obviously awesome)
even though it requires custom logic and probably a separate custom app, it would be REALLY cool to integrate them both together
connect(forclosureReader, SIGNAL(listRead(QList<Properties>)), craigslistPoster, SLOT(postList(QList<Properties>)));
forclosureReader and craigslistPoster are of type WebsiteAutomator... and their contents must be parcelized(??) to enable creation on the fly from definitions pulled from the web (service)
making it easy for the user to connect the two is what's tricky.

i digress, back to the point
what should i focus on?
4chan poster (spammer) vs. 4chan reader (4chan web browser)
craigslist poster (spammer) vs. forclosure reader (or even craigslist reader)
etc
ideally, it'd be nice to do both at the same time... but that will be a pain in the ass to get right on the first try
