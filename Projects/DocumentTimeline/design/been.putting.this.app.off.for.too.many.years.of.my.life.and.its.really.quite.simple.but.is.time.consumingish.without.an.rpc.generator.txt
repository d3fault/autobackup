Although the rpc generator tangent has been extremely beneficial (unlike my previous attempt at it (fml)), I need to put off expanding upon it (AutoDrilldown and AutoDb, in particular) and simply use it to make DocumentTimeline. I just bought the .com... I'm really surprised it was available. The rest of the tlds will come to me once I have the trademark (and I'm already claiming it (but still to file a trademark claim to get tlds is about a G a piece (and having the trademark registered expedites the process))). I also realized the Gui Widget version has no short-term benefit, so I should just focus on the Wt one.
