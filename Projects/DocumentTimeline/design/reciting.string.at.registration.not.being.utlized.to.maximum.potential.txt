mfw just realized the whole "recite string at registration" thing is useless without the entire system being cryptographically verified. ACTUALLY, I'm not sure that's the case ONLY because it's a "private business dht impl". The random string reciting still serves the purpose of weeding out fake registration attempts (and at least some trolls), but admittedly isn't being used to it's fullest potential (cryptographically). This is a KISS project, fuck it.
