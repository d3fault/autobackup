remix [yourself] infinitely

start with others work
play on top of it
add a layer
a layer which needs to be removable
but this is your layer
when exploring, you never see anything with your layer on it
d3fault will have a cross-link structure like wikipedia based on large paged words. we can create a boringWordList for like the,a,etc,oh.and.etc

i was originally thinking music (got this idea while listening to (and therefore remixing) Harperactive - MSNcore (instrumental)), but it applies to code as well.
