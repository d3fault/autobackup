re: c) in my previous idea

the api for an rpc generated interface should be auto-generated too

i mean, we use in our code an api that is generated
but we should be able to check an additional box at code generation step that says "make API public also"
gives them some json/xml/REST/etc API that matches identically the API that the (MAYBE-auto-generated (but won't be at first)) web gui that they use to do manual operations on the site ([a] in previous idea)
