"Quick Dinner"
"would you like to have a quick dinner with me?"
means sex
i will take over that phrase so that it is never said except for sex
the idea is you can discuss how much you are going to give them


this is how it goes:
"would you like to have dinner with me?"
"yes, how much are you going to spend on me?"
"$100"
"ok"
*meet up*
*start fucking*
"oh whoops we had sex, here's this $100 i promised you for dinner. suddenly i'm not hungry"


legal immunity because it is the same thing all marriages do, more or less
