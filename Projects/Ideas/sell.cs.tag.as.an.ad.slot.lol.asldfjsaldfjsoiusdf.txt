sell your cs tag as an ad slot
would be cool for me live streaming or whatever...
...but pros would get much more use from it

an app to update your spray once a day or whatever


valve would probably try to steal this idea/the profits because they're pretty fucking gay

there might need to be a specified amount of times you promise to spray per day (which also means you have to play every day??)... but maybe not. supply and demand might take care of that. if you don't spray, nobody will buy your slots

maybe instead of cycling the slots every 24 hours... they're cycled on on the days in which you play. they last 24 hours from when you play. so if you DO play once every 24 hours, the change-time will always remain constant... but if you take a week break, the new cycle-time will be the minute you opened up the game after that week... and it will continue to cycle daily if you continue to play daily. but that doesn't make sense because the 2nd day we won't even know if they're going to play it. i guess it could use up the 24 hours assuming they're going to play that day... but if they don't, put the 2nd day back into the queue and go into "change-cycle-time" mode for whenever they DO play again. logistics fuck it.

valve might also ban this...

...but i do want to make my own game heh. i could do it no doubt
