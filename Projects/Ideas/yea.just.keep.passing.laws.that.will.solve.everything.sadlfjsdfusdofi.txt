TODOreq for fun: given all the legal text for a given jurisdiction (so for gilbert, az: us&a, arizona, mariciopa, gilbert), calculate using the "average characters per minute reading rate" (guess one if needed) how long it would take to read all the laws a person is held accountable for. Add roughly 6-7 years to account for the amount of time it takes for a human to learn to read (to a shitty level btw). I wonder what the result would be?
