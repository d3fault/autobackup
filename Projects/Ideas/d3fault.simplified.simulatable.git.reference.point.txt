like if 'git integration' with Qt Creator meant that every time i save, I sync
with my git branch AND the remotes. this, however, is not the same as
committing. comitting is distinct and has git messages. also more likely to
compile. the 'other' shit, behind the scenes (of git commits... but still very
important data and still redundified)... is presented in a timeline fashion.
keystrokes with per-sentence charactersPerSecond auto-averaging / playback,
with pauses with (pause.length > (thatAverageCps * 1.5)).

so there's like "auto-sync'ing" but also "snapshot creation"

the 'moment'... the 'snapshot'... is just a specific point in time in the
timeline of the auto-syncs... with a textual commit message ("1.0 release" etc)
attached. there could even be tags to go with the commits/snapshots: _Release:1
or who knows what/how. but like integrated with the underlying messageData /
software itself, making commit messages filterable.
