fuckin paranoia and procrastination

moved a few mp3s to this offline/devbox

listening to them is POTENTIALLY/THEORETICALLY leaking data

inaudible frequencies

TODO: schizOS, use this technique

inaudible frequencies could be outputting to my celly (tracking/recording device) all kinds of data


jesus fucking christ being smart is a whatcha-ma-callit
curse?


meh
igorance is bliss.


that complex output-only/input-only solution that i haven't solved yet doesn't have this problem

music players need to be un-trusted


the mp3s don't even necessarily need to be corrupt
only the software needs to be
not even necessarily the music player (mplayer in this case)

the underlying drivers could be injecting inaudible tones

think: dial-up internet
