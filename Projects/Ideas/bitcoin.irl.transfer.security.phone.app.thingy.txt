bitcoin irl transfer
i give him a bitcoin address from the screen of my phone.
this is the only piece of valuable data that the phone has at the given moment
he enters it and pays me money for a product.
i sit by my phone and wait for the LED to turn a certain color
this only happens if multiple servers behind the scenes that i own all verify that the payment was processed
this is the only signal it processes. it doesn't know what the signal is for, but i do. of course signed/verified
