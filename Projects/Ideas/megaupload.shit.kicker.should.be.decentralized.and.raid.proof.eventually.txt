for that auto-scaling self-sustaining generic file hosting site mega project that will probably make fuck tons of money


i should make it decentralized.


it's ok if it's after the fact

but what i'm saying is....

..it needs to be PREPARED to be shut down

each node should be able to respond to commands given by a certain private key
doesn't matter WHO gives the orders (but it WILL be a centralized server at first... and until the inevitable 'raid')


this is all mostly for fun btw

this whole generic file hosting thing

sure i'll make money

and sure it'll be awesome for warez

but i don't give a fuck about it.

don't spend too much time on it.
it sounds time consuming.
focus on d3fault
your baby
your love
your dream
