notify a notifier figured out

i mean basically something like splitting the 'notifying' job

one master notifier and 1 to many slave notifiers
or perhaps master can be the 1 in the case of 1

but 2 doesn't make sense, unless they split the load evenly
BUT THEN DOES THE CHUNKSERVER UPDATE BOTH OF THEM??? exactly stfu

i mean i guess the master notifier can say "i'll do this half. hey slave bitch, you do this half"
or maybe the slave should already know who to push and shit too

but yea i think after we get past that initial point


oh i don't know



but i do know this




IF I CODE MY OWN, I CAN USE QDATASTREAM >> AND <<
rofl
is that worth coding a fucking dht from scratch?

business broski
priorities
prioritize!

couchbase seems aight

honestly, the only 2 remaining questions i have with couchbase (note: as of this doc, ALL my questions are answered with custom gfs-like/couchbase-like) are:
'tap' ing into a server, which i guess is like getting updates/notifies? i've read about it but yet to see concrete examples
and hotspots n shit

i don't know they don't have hotspot balancing
but a search for 'couchbase key hotspot' and 'couchbase key bottleneck' returned nothing of relevance

perhaps a forum post for the second one

and just GO LOOK HARDER FOR DOC FOR TAPPING



i kinda sorta wanna code a fukken dht
it sounds fun

AND, it will let me use my Rpc Generator for some cool shit pretty much instantly~ fuck yea (note i am paused with that, not stuck. considering message re-use optimizations but meh shit's mad boring/easy compared to dht ('boring' you say? so you like the challenge? if it isn't a challenge you drop it and resume it later? maybe that's why you dropped video right after you perfected the design ROFL. didn't impl it tho fml wish i woulda o well always later and i still got dem designs ;-)))
