a 'value' of the dht (d3fault)
could be running expensive distributed operations on the network
you have to earn them by donating cpu/bandwidth
and you can sell them for cash

the only example i can think of: facial recognition

any picture as input, rectangle select face
find dat person in all images
try to find name too (if personImage/name db exists i guess idfk)
