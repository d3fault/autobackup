captcha and ad image should be one
the top half is an ad
the bottom half is a captcha

ad publishers would like this because then they KNOW the ad was seen by a human
it is impossible to NOT see the ad (unless a script/app crops the image lolol (workaround: random(0,1) tells us if the captcha is on top or bottom. owned))

google would love this info
