after/during launch, assuming no kaylee (doesn't look very likely), i can/should/might flip a coin to decide if i will live as a male or a female
just for the lulz
because i genuinely don't give a shit
and i am obsessed with randomness

NO HORMONES
i don't want my brain modified sorry
but implants face lifts hair changes etc are all fair game

for teh lulz

i also won't talk differently
but then again, a lot of people tell me i sound like a girl anyways :-P


i could rig it
to be female
because it would get 10000000% more attention (and therefore money)
using my finger-feeling trick
someone calls me out, who gives a fuck -- come clean
it would only be seen as 'bad' if i used the finger-feeling trick to remain male

i want kaylee more than this
but it would be fun and is something i could consider
i guess it's something i am considering
technically
i've thought of it before
like "meh"

but i don't want to become an whore and get STDs y0


BUT REALLY


one thing it DOES do is help me deal with my shame
of 'homosexual' -ness
the video i made of myself cumming on myself
for example
if that got leaked and i was a straight male
eh....
well you get the idea
fuckin normal shit for a trap.


whatever you do
don't do it out of angst from rejection from kaylee
that being said, maybe i should leave it to pure random
geniune flip
no rigging


i think i'd get more sex with hotter bitches (and traps) if i myself was a trap
but i'd need to take extra precautions about getting STDs
which is implicit when you're being filmed 24/7 anyways...
fucking hugely frowned upon slutting about spreading diseases (INFECTIONS)

i want to be a cyborg more than i want to be a shemale
apathetic, tbh
slightly weird that i am
but also kinda makes sense
IT DOES NOT MATTER
nothing mattress ;-P
for t3h LULZ

i am seriously smarter than most
most people
and i would probably be the smartest trap [that i know of]
trap programmer hacker gamer drug enthusiast

might also provoke assassination
or be left alone
who knows


girls get away with doing stupid shit in public easier
fact.

'fingers' would look less odd on a girl
as with dancing

but i need to admit i can't dance
fact: i can't dance

but who cares
it's fun to try (and fail)

the whole point is NOT CARING

same with my shitty music

i am a coder
fact
