passwords that are memorizable for humans have a time limit

meaning, computers will someday (soon?) surpass in brute force abilities all words and combinations of words (obviously, combinations of letters is implied since it's a brute force)

computers will simply be too fast

and can brute force a 30 character password in a matter of seconds


so what's the point of encryption?
i mean now yea it buys us time

but what about then?

obviously the certs and shit would just grow in size

but passwords needs to be human memorizable
wat do?

'cert/password-FILE' you carry around on thumb drive?

perhaps that should be my solution

fuck passwords.

could put a thumb drive up me arse (no pickpocketting etc)

but meh
compromising the usb is compromising your security

you won't have the ability to plausibly deny a hidden partition like with truecrypt by giving the wrong key

interrogators would give you ex lax and then just wait...

rofl.

passwords are temporary
as in, we can only use them NOW

in the future, they will be irrelevant/un-usable

this is a huge discovery that impacts pretty much all aspects of security: wat do

maybe i should rename minddump to 'security is bullshit'

this article be the main thing it's referring to

seriously
why encrypt?
why password?

i think long term

sure verify/authenticate (grow keylen as necessary) is handy as FUCK

but keep secret (password'ify/encrypt) ???? == USELESS

in long term at least

again, not referring to HTTPS / certs method where no user password is used for encryption/decryption but machine keys are

but more of like the d3fault storage mechanism


ASIDE: _some_ obfuscation is helpful even if the passwords are stored somewhere else (ie, not 'secret'). freenet has the promise that the owner of a node does not know what the contents of what he is holding is... for example.
