crowd sourced music

finger arduino shits

i was wataching some rusko at a show and noticing how the dj is up on the stage as the center of the attention waving his arms about like a faggot
i'd like to be in the pit dancing my ass off with finger rig making it realtime

and i got the good idea that it would be badass to give that shit to everyone in the show
they beat their fingers to whatever portion of the music they like and they take the music wherever they feel it should go
there's no way it would come out bad
everybody can move to a beat

doesn't have to be fingers only. in fact it probably definitely shouldn't.
