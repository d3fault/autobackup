global merge
global diff
color if immediate diff (say, red)
different color and FADING OUT as progressively more "past" (say, blue -> white/translucent). color is yellow

ok better is immediate red, recent yellow fading. i think yellow fades fast (to human eye). faster than blue. green might work, but we need to remember our font is white

actually fuck that black screen white font is best for eyes and most energy conserving


so black background around everything, white text everywhere. since red/white don't distinguish as well, an always black border around the white before the background. with white on black it is not noticed, but with white on red it is
