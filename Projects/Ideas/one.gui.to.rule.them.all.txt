req for gui system

you can vectorize rendered raster with somewhat decent results
but when the widgets have sophisticated corners and shapes or whatever then it
quickly loses it's value and becomes a cost

d3fault should use it (this is not req for gui system of course)

steam overlay
QSG*-using
QWidgets1-like interface (as similar as possible)
uhh something about designEquals having auto-generated GUI
yea i mean i think i could do it
and even have customizable GUI
ok now can i do shared? what is shared? whared what?
dumbass shared means like network shared shit like on a network where anyone
can download shit. even if you use a dht ad-supported cluster to bootstrap it,
get that motherfucker up. you can/will/should/definitely-intend-to-MAKE a
self-sustaining-infinitely-living-completely-decentralized ad-free p2p LGPL
version... but security is the bitch.
inline-editable... but this idea goes in with the shared shit

i will make sure to announce "your data is not guaranteed to be safe. you
should keep backups. <a href'adslfkj'>here</a> is a backup utility that plugs
in nicely and has a wizard/instructions on how to safely/securely do an
"offline" + "offsite" backup". offsite being a lot harder

<wrote after Qwidgets1....>
it will simply be QWidgets2
you opt into it
a lot of times if you just use the default QWidget shit in non-complicated
ways, your code should just compile.

can both be attained?
do i has teh skillz?

should i just ask? has it been done?
