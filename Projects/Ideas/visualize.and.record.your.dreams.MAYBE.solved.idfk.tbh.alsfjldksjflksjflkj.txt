I want to get one of those neuro activity readers that have a programming library interface. 
0) First I want to train my brain to be able to draw any [basic] color on the screen... the full screen.
1) Then I split the screen in half and try to color both sides to my choosing
2) Then I split the screen in half again (perpendicularly) and try to color all 4 parts
3) Repeat until you get to 1080p

Now you can visualize and record your DREAMS.


I have no idea how to do audio, but there's gotta be some way that's analogous to the above.
