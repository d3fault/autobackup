so i need to capture "what i see" in terms of "operating system" or "reality"... but i also need to have a "lossless" capturing mode where i am capturing the screen itself (think PRNTSCRN). when i am "in" that mode [only], there is no reason to capture what my eyeballs are seeing because i see nothing else. if i captured what my eyeballs were seeing, it would just be the screen but it would look a million times shittier than the PRNTSCRN method.


perhaps it is wise to capture what my eyeballs see just in case the screen i am working on crashes/etc? this is a bootstrap consideration.



however it should be noted that whenever i pull away from the OS screen (which, tangent, CAN still have a camera capturing reality (i only see reality THROUGH A CAMERA)), the "camera that is capturing whatever my eyes see" is activated again. perhaps there should be a visual cue to let the viewers/audience know that i am not using the "camera to capture reality for blending transparently with the operating system" and am instead using the "what my eyes see" camera (to them it will look identical). they need to be different cameras because the "what my eyes see" camera will only be able to see the screen itself whenever i am looking at the screen (unless some crafty robot arm swings it around in front of the screen whenever i go IN to the screen (this sounds more difficult than it's worth... but in the long run... ;-P)).


considering i plan to broadcast all of the cameras simultaneously and in full quality, they can at any moment activate the "what my eyes see" camera and watch that one only 24/7/365 if they want. but as for the "show" i am going to present, it will use camera switching techniques both manual and automated. manually initially and automated wherever i see fit.




TODOoptional: i could also have another mode where on my left eye i see the "reality input camera" on that half of the screen and on my right eye i see the operating system.... but the "transparent blending" method sounds much less headache-inducing. as an optimization to this mode, the left eye doesn't really need to use the additional camera. it can just use the "what my eyes see" camera, instead of making my left eye look at a screen that is dedicated to the reality input camera. pointless (and less megajixels ftl).



there will probably also be a 3rd party outsider perspective full body view of me, though this might compromise my hidden compromise activities (a physical wall fixes that problem lmfao)



the easiest solution to do things hidden as a compromise is to simply disallow one of my "what my eyes see" cameras (assuming i have one for each eye: something i hadn't thought of yet) so i can see the activity clearly. i just do not record it or broadcast it.




what is done behind that wall is crucial and incredibly important. i will try to, to the best of my ability, be honest about what i am doing. it is easy to take advantage of and to do evil while "appearing transparent". however, considering politicians in the year 2012 have full on privacy, this isn't really a huge deal naw mean? i am not choosing to take advantage of it for evil deeds. i am promising MYSELF (the only person a promise is worthwhile to) to keep it to an absolute bare minimum so as to avoid prison for whatever reason. it is a bootstrap because we have shit laws in the year 2012.
