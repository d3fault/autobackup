the video is streamed. whether it's p2p or vimeo style is irrlevant
but it is live.
the live stream has an advertisement. the advertisement is a rectangular image shown like 4 times a day or something. not very often (variable)
the pixel grid lost behind the advertisement is encrypted. maybe compressed using xvid type shit but i gotta test that to see how it comes out. maybe only zip compression (the first stream + ad are definitely encrypted, preferably. unless it turns out i can't for some reason. actually this would be too expensive if i didn't). anyways the decryption key to it is released later. the original copy (sans ad) is then saved. the ad copy is never written to disk. you are 3 minutes behind. your 'requesting verification of de-advertised sha512' is actually what the system uses to verify that it was written correctly in the dht. that would be for a d3fault version obviously... but i can do it with couchbase first. and i should. that would be plenty of incentive for people to watch ads. live. it would also set a standard that others will mimic. not live? no ads. hopefully. at least, that'd be cool if they did.
