Simple mp fps where the players faces are video streams from webcam of actual player face. The bandwidth should prioritize the gameplay stuff and not the video stream. I always get carried away thinking about this and how it could use p2p networking, but I should ignore that and do it regular client-server style to start. or maybe the gameplay could do client-server style and the video streams are p2p.
