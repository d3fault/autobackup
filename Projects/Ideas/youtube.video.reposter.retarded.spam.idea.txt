mirroring/reuploading movie trailers etc.. popular 'media' and just calling it like your show or something.. you don't even need to change the video
you can automate this and also pull from  publically available statistics to 'randomly' select semi-popular subjects/videos to mirror
this on a large scale could make money
laundering is a bitch though
