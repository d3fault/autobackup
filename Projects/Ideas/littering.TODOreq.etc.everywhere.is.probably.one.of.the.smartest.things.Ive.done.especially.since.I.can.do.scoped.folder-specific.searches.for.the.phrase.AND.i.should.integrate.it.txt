You know, I really like my 'TODOreq' / 'TODOoptimization' strategy and wish to continue using it indefinitely, even after d3fault/designEquals exist. I mean, it should become integrated with them. I should be able to put those in designs, code, documents... and have them be synchronized in some GUI and of course teh "I'm bored, gimmeh somethin to do = spits out a TODO<somethin> (that certainly is not all the I'm bored button does.. but it's one of the [many] things. Should be pluggable if ya know what I mean)" lmfao.
