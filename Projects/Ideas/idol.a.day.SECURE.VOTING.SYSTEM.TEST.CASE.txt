american idol
idoladay (idol a day... one per day for each category... sooo... LOTS)

bitcoin ads are revenue source
people submit videos (a la youtube (could be link or upload)) and review others'
it could be used without beefy security and still would provide a profit

but my [better] idea is to use it to test out the "video authentication" scheme

you read off a public decryption key or whatever in a video to confirm that a) you are a person and b) you are legit and your public key associated with your profile matches etc or something (haven't worked out the fine details in this but yea...)
basically it's just to test the functionality/security of a voting system
because WHO GIVES A FUCK who the daily idol is
obviously millions of dipshits do...
but it isn't a risk

...as putting a person in power using such a voting system IS a risk.
so yea anyways that idea could easily make millions and millions,, even without the beefy security

lol life's fucking easy
