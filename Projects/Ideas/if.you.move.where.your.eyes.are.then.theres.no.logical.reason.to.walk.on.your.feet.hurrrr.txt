Walk on your hands with a camera attached to your heal (facing "behind you" (though forward when walking on your hands (right where your eyes would be if right side up))). Place a video screen in front of your eye[s]. Two cameras + two screens also/optionally (one on each eye/heal). And now funny/semi-OT: would you criss-cross the camera/screen connection, so that your right eye is connected to your left heal? Try both obviously. I'm theorizing criss cross would seem more natural (but also might make you dizzy when removed (or if the other configuration is more natural (or just in general because shit you are upside-down noob))).

Would be fun to practice and make that your only form of "walking". You'd need gloves/shoes and man oh man would your arms/torso become fucking ripped.

Also semi-OT again: you might gain an advantage if for instance a fucking lion attacks your "neck" but they end up biting your shins because shit you are upside-down noob. Then again snakes/etc would now bight your face/real-neck instead of just your shins ffffffffffff
