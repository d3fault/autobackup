time lapse over years of working out
i think with my body especially the results would be significant
not sure if it'd just be 1 workout station or multiple

if multiple, the video can focus on the muscle being worked

but there should definitely be an 'overall' (full body) view...

perty good long term idea

a lot of people do this with their faces
i could show my body literally growing
i'm skinny as FUCK atm.
