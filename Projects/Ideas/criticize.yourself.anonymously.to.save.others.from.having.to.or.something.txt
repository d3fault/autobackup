i could be my #1 criticizer

d3fault is public/etc
'anon' criticizes me
but it is really me, posting anonymously, criticizing myself

i can.. i guess you could say... get everything out of the way
to save myself and others time?

i'd be capable of using the conflict to stage things. that's vague, but i know
it's possible. opportunity will arise and i will recognize it


i can have d3fault be filmed 24/7 and his fingers on the keyboard visually
recorded

and my anon attacker/self could be typing using only feet

yes it'd be hard to type a critical essay while playing counter-strike and not
looking at the screen i'm typing on.. while typing with my feet...

..but it's certainly possible.
