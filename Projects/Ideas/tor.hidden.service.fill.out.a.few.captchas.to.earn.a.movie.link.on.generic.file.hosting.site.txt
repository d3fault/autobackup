a tor hidden service (for the management portion)
you fill out like 5+ captchas as 'payment' to get a link to download a movie

the URL is obfuscated, and the file is possibly even encrypted.

it is stored on some generic file hosting site.

we could even monitor the download count. if it spikes up higher than it should be (indicating it was posted on a forum),
we delete it and make a new mirror

spike should not be 1 or 2

it should be like a percentage of whatever we expect given however many captchas have been filled out


and yea, we sell the captchas / automation of course (hence tor hidden service)


the biggest 'expense' would be getting bandwidth + IPs to upload to the generic file hosting sites

we'd need to maintain mirrors of every tv show + movie... would be expensive as fuck

but there's gotta be a balancing point between profits from number of captchas and cost of servers to maintain warez archive

perhaps the 'upload a movie as payment' idea is better
