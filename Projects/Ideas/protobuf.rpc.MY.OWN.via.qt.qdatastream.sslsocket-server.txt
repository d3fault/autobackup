i could [later] make my own protobuf rpc generation equivalent

using struct/enum protocol + (OPTIONIAL via checkmark) SSL -> TcpSocket

it could probably factor in with the diagram object DESIGN=IMPLEMENTATION
for cross-network (thread?) rpc

the difference between cross-network and cross-thread is actually minute
just the means of getting it across
they are ESSENTIALLY the same thing...
so it could be abstracted as such (TODO: GET REALLY HIGH AND THINK OF WHAT THE FUCK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT + DOCUMENT/CODE IT)
