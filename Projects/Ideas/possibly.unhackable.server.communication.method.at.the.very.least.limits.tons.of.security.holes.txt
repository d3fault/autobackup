my write only video QR-code shit can be used on a 'server'

a... central data authority
even a dht / couchbase cluster


there's an actual webserver (no trust given to him) connected to the web

he translates requests into QR/video and sends them to the way-more-secure
server/cluster

server/cluster only takes instructions/data (both. ex:
instruction:dataPacketComingOfSizeXYZ, then: data123 (size=XYZ)) through a very
limited QR protocol.

there are the predefined instructions specific to the server's domain
and data blobs that are never executed. by forcing the data blobs over an
hdmi/dvi/vga (vga sounds safest because it's analog) cable, we stip the data
blobs (even in the predefined instructions) of malicious data. they'd have to
find a hole in the hopefully-robust QR/video protocol. the more limited it is,
the easier it is to secure. we cut out all the rest of the operating system's
security holes using this method. that's the biggy.


the server can even respond using the exact same method of information
transport.

there is no 'ack' when sending a packet (or whatever says 'i got that packet,
send the next). the communicating is write-only

the video writer and reader NEED to be of sufficient speed. if they miss data,
it is missed. maybe we could request it again.. but that requires us to do a
video write of our own (expensive obviously)

so either dedicated / non-stressed (cpu-wise) hardware
or realtime software... which i know nothing about (except that it makes hard
guarantees in performance)
