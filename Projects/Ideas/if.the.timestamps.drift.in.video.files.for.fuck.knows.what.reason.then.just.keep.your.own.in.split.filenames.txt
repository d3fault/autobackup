When I was experimenting with syncing a/v earlier (week or so ago), I ended up having to calculate a very precise fps for the video so that it was in sync at the beginning and in sync at the end. I assumed that if I did that, it'd be in sync in the middle. I have no fucking clue why still (maybe the software on the video cap device is garbage?), but I just now thought of a hacky as fuck solution to the problem. I could use a Hottee-esq solution that changes target files every few MB. Should write the timestamp at the switch. Idfk what kind of ffmpeg interaction there would be from then on, but eh I'm sure something could be managed (sounds like hell, fuck this idea).
