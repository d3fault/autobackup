signal: "we just noticed finger X slid Ymm/units and did NOT cross over the digital/binary axis. each finger has two signals. 1 is clicked/toggled/triggered, the other is positionChanged(1-1024). you can get fine tuned or just triggered, but this helper can be listened to and we can present the user a prompt to see if they want to tweak where the crossover is in the 0-1023 range. it can be used at all times (configurable thresholds) or only in a training mode
it could be off most of the time, but ON during Typedia/practice mode

typing will use the digital switch

there needs to be some digital switch to instantly toggle all the fingers from digital to analog
or idk some way to use both

dream: type/code while making music... or AT THE VERY LEAST while dancing to it. listening to both digital + analog signals would allow for that
