the manner in which my software is distributed, on d3fault.net
should provide a documented configuration utility so a user can clone EXACTLY the distribution onto their own domain

it should be noted that they are given the option of a) using the existing dht/network/d3fault or b) starting their own


tangent: show ads on http/www served (by d3fault.net/com/org) dht/network/d3fault content via ABC

back to what i was saying:
my distribution on d3fault.net, INCLUDING d3fault.net itself (the Wt app is part of the distribution) is configured to:
a) use the d3fault network
b) follow 'd3fault' (me) by default

their difference SHOULD only be to (b), as replicating (a) is wasted effort imo (unless they disagree with me fundamentally on some design/code/etc (THERE'S STILL MAIN/MASTER + THEIR OWN BRANCH AND CHANGING (b), so wtf?))
b) follow 'them' by default



bitchtits.net could download the distribution, run the distribution-generation-configuration(??) tool, and basically the only thing they change is the default channel thingo to follow 'bitchtits' instead of 'd3fault' (me)
they collect the ad revenue for viewing dht/d3fault content via bitchtits.net


this allows for fork-without-forking behavior, where everybody wins
