a somewhat safe failover is to make sure all needed ram for normal operation is pre-allocated (at program start) and of course destroyed at shutdown
but then it leaves the rest for like tcp connections or whatever


actually there are multiple reasons to failover

i don't even mean failover
i mean... request a helper
"why can't i carry all these packets?" <-- i should make this meme and use it with advertising the gpl'd impl

this could be any dht node type

chunkserver
client
master
couldn't the domains
i forget that thought
don't even remember writing it


meh
as i was saying though
there are multiple reasons to failover

not enough memory
not enough cpu
not enough bandwidth

there are probably more?

catching any one of them by itself is tricky
it needs very well designed softwares

but it is possible

meh i do not think it is worth the investment at this time
fucking difficult and i'd maybe never finish it

better to make something workable for now and then optimize where optimizations are needed
i probably will not be able to predict where bottlenecks will pop up
i may even have a difficult time finding them
