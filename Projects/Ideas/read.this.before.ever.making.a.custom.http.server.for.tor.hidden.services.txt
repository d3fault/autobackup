Qt already has support for the HTTP protocol.
I am thinking about writing my own using strings and making it minimal


HOWEVER, I might be able convince myself that the following method is safe enough:

HTTP headers are the main cause of leaking...
...so I can sanitize them based on a whitelist

I can search for an IP address pattern in the header (perhaps only the "Host" key)

but more importantly, I can just filter out both key/value for anything I _DON'T_ recognize.

A whitelist of the basics for every response (request? I guess both since I'm talking about a Tor hidden-service and a Tor node client to that hidden service (should note I am NOT talking about web pages here. wait wtf why would I use http then fuckin a this is dumb and pointless)) is faster than making my own http server
