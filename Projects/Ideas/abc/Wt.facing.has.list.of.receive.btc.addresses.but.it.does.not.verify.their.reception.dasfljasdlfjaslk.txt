Wt/net-facing does have a notion of bitcoin. it has a list of "receive addresses" that it disperses to users (they have to fill out an adcaptcha to get one.. and only get one until a payment is received to it)
Wt hands out addresses, and tells the local/.onion server to "be on the lookout" for that transaction in the chain. once i see it locally, i tell the net-facing one via it's .onion (so i retain my anonymity) that it is legit
that's the reception process
a bit of a bitch....
...but as secure as i can possibly think


we're dealing with MONEY systems here
security is HIGH AS FUCK priority.
