make the index followable
either provide them space (i would need a massive dns cluster to handle this i think)
or just crawl their domain and mark out sites. like a 5 level recursion limit on the site, not following any others.

that's the "Index"
so they have to do business with me to be on the "index"
but the cost of business is "cheap"
(when it should be nothing ;-))
so people will sign up

and a gfs-like

maybe a search function? but then this would imply i am crawling non-business-with sites
so basically: do i want to be a nigger or not?

how about this: i can let anyone add a site for free (maybe just a captcha verification)

but the default mode cannnot/should-not be be scraping everything
