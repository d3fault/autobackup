the amount i should launder should be completely random
random number generators etc

say like $2000 - $5000 a month
a rand() in between the two
then divided up into 15-500 payments (rand())
each payment amount is also determined via rand() and the time it is sent is also rand()
it is ok for them to come at the same time if that's what the rand() says to do.
it would look retarded if it was linear.
