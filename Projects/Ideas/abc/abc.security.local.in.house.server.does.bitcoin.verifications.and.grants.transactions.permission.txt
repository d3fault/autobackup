abc security
a central server with my Wt web-app
this server keeps track of user balances etc
and it handles the bulk of the bandwidth

whenever a transaction is placed,
my local server that i have physical control over is the one that verifies the payment
it runs a local Qt/Bitcoin app

i don't trust server admins

also, before/as a user attempts to purchase a service (or cash out or whatever), their balance is verified. we keep 2 copies of the balance database. 1x local server (master copy), 1x webserver (sort of just like a cached number... since they're going to view their balance way more often than they're going to modify it)

once i make more i should buy an office and put the server in there with some uber IRL security in place
RFID card shit + webcams with motion detectors etc

at this point i can probably also move the web-facing server in there too.. but it still might be smarter to outsource the high-bandwidth shit... so maybe not..

perty excited about getting an office...
... it will be my home away from home
might even get an office before i get a house.
