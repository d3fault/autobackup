abc = anon / noref, primary funding

wasdf/project go outside/d3fault... whether broadcasted live or not (regular updates instead of live, idgaf. depends how much balls i have) == primary laundering technique. i ask for donations from the world






the only thing this contradicts is BlueBox using AdDouble/AdCaptcha
errr, i mean.. the video library using it
video library is associated to me
video library -> AdDouble/AdCaptcha

BlueBox just refernces them

YOU KNOW WHAT
the solution is easy
BlueBox (anon/noref ALREADY) will have the AdDouble/AdCaptcha



so woot there is no contradiction



there will be a period of time where i WILL have money but i have to pretend that i do not.


i should lie about receiving donations to wasdf/etc ONLY VIA TEXT
people are smart enough to read a lie on a video
"oh wow look cool i got a donation of $x cool thanks"
i'd be a shit liar
not that it even MATTERS
legal proof != people "knowing"

still, it's wise to keep people from knowing if you're intentions are to hide it

i don't think i have to hide abc...
but i guess i should?



OH I SHOULD MENTION THAT I DO ALSO LEGITIMATELY LAUNDER THE BITCOIN VIA ALREADY-EXISTING LAUNDERING SERVICES BEFORE DONATING TO WASDF/etc
