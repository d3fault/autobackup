Bitcoin-Qt

not only should i copy code from that liberally for use with ABC...

...but i should offer a modified version of the client on abc.com for my users
it allows you to right click on your transaction(s) and say "mix" or "shuffle" or whatever
and there is a checkbox for "auto-mix all"

legality of this is questionable
security is also difficult but certainly possible
i could take a low as fuck percentage
1%
.5%
it'll add up....................................



people would LOVE it because of it's ease of use
