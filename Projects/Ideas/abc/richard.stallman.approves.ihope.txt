i will make money off the network, but the network will abide by 'concrete-promise.com' (aka, don't spy on your users)
which is enforced through code
which is open source
and gpl'd

initially
it is not for sale
so only i can profit from it

well i mean they can port it and make money from that
but good luck buddy.
derivatives need to be open source and so why would they use your derivatives if they could just be merged back into upstream?
you cannot open source it unless it is gpl
you cannot distribute it unless it is gpl

holy fuck richard stallman is a genius



this is my 
d3fault early impl on private/business
OR
strictly abc venture and not having anything revolutionary



i do think i could do an anonymous paxos master chubby cluster with each node in the cluster being in a different datacenter/company/country and same with each of the clients (and their replicas... or is each client a fully capable one) and the chunkservers. auto failover mode for all = 'bot-net' ish 'website'. i could just purchase new domains whenever old ones get siezed. so long as i have tor private key... or maybe those are per-server and matter less. as long as i control the cluster which is a distributed data store and front end (even if only accessible via tor for the time being (specific nodes are front-ends or they all are? i guess all. they all act as clients. oh i need silent failover servers noob. as in, the failed-over-to machine did not have a previously known location. this implies that a master or something similar would have to read a replica that went down, and then write it to the hidden/now-online server. the replica that goes down and the hidden/now-online one cannot have communicated (message forwarding for replication) in order for it to be unknown. so we just have to cross our fingers that all 3 replicas don't go down at the same time. if they do, we're fucked. maybe i need way more than 3. one bug and i'm fucked.))
