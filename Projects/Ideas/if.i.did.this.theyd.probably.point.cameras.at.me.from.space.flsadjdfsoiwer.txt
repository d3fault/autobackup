i want to go skipping out in the wilderness connected/coding/dancing/hopping/living. uhh man idk if that much lightweightness is doable. hoppable with a backpack? there's no way you could survive without one and i don't think you could hop even with a regular sized backpack on...

I wrote this before Raspberry Pi + Arduino/Fingers?

Oh my god I have so many fucking documents and amazing ideas.

I need to launch asep.


Fuck these Rpc / Ack problems. I can't find that balance doc I'm looking for :-/
