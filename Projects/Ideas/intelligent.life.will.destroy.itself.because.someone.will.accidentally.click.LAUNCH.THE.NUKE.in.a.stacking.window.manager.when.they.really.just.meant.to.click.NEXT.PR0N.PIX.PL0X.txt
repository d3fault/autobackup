a) Tooltips should never get in the way of a mouse click and a button (best way to solve this is to not allow tooltips to ever be beneath pointer. letting tooltips go beneath mouse pointer and then clicking THROUGH tooltip would be similar to (b))
b) Windows should never be brought to focus in front of what the user is already doing. Some window managers already do this. Here is a (maybe shitty) idea for an enhancement to them: when the mouse enters the "window" (non-stacking, err i forget the word but like a fucking grid), the window can expand to take up more/most of the screen. Whether or not the window stays "in position" relative to where the mouse was in the window when it entered (and exitted?)... idfk and maybe should be customizeable. Also, the idea might be completely shit because if you move your mouse into one and are referencing/typing-from another, the text you are looking at might now become hidden. Perhaps a way to fix THAT is to make certain windows (or better, window regions ;-P) locked in place
