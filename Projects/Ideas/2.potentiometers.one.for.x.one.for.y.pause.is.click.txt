using 2 potentiometers. one attached to each index finger
the out position is 0,0
left index controls x
right index controls y
the in position is resx_max,resy_max

how to click?
a pause at anywhere except 0,0 is a click
a pause will use an averaging algorithm for whatever size object it is over (uses it's projected (if 3d) dimensions)
