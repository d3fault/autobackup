we too could put the generating of 'coins'/currency at the finding of a bunch of leading zeros in the hashing of a piece of data
but i think each 'set of operations' (or just a single operation) should be done IN SYNC with the network as a whole. you are not allowed to perform the operation (and therefore report on it/claim a credit) until the proper time. maybe 1 operation a minute, idk. long term: auto-scaling for optimized(based on? stability i guess. and not wanting to needlessly overload the system). perhaps you aren't even able to perform the operation to (which you can equate to drawing a single lottery ticket and checking it) until the new node comes in... like, you need it's hash or something. that makes sense actually.
