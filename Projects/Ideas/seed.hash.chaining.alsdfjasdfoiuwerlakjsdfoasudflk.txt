seed hash chaining
first seed is the video. whether encrypted or not is irrelevant, but encrypted might be worthwhile to bind it with a public/private key?


actually, VERY FIRST (offline. do on a safe computer and then format it afterwards) seed is mouse generated in keepass/truecrypt. i could provide a util for this i guess (or take their qwidget ;-P)
that seeded random number generator is a secure one, and it is used to generate your private/public key
you say the public key IN the video, and sign your video with the private key
the encrypted video's hash, or the contents itself, unsure if it matters



we want to have predictable-guaranteed-randomness (their data?) and ACTUAL_RANDOMNESS  (others' data?) from other nodes collide to provide verifiable consistency back to a root object (the video)
their data is not predictably random
but their seed hash chain needs to be?
the direction it takes is predictable ONLY GIVEN a) the last seed chained/predicted and b) the new data (whether theirs or someone else's)
