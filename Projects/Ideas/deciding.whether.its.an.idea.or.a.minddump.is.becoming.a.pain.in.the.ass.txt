boostrap.h installs via yum git via localinstall which then downloads the rpms and install + configure script. eventually it would be cool to have a public encryption key on there which just encrypts before writing to the repository. i want user level functionality that requires a custom repository. fml. so given this script that also stores your data (and everyone else's too? under a different username + public? choice) you are never tied to a particular OS so long as the OS implements a specific install manager type (implementations of which can be built where none suitable exist, with ease of inserting a new application to the list ESPECIALLY on the new implementations is a breeze)
