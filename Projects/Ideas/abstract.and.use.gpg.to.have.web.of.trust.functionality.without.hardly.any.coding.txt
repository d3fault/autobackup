i could just use gpg2's functionality for an encrypted trust network. the "server" is localhost which places on dht. your files are versioned. you have a name/val property in your person for "files" (it is a pointer, so we're storing a key to another ) which has a name/val property. that's assuming the network server's customizable, but of course it is because it's open source and i can just recompile. is the server code public? i bet it is. so i can get the protocol for it and just rewrite the storage or figure out the protocol from it i mean? the dht has to implement the protocol? yes exactly. at localhost. to receive keys using their shit. i bet you can use their server as a library too.
