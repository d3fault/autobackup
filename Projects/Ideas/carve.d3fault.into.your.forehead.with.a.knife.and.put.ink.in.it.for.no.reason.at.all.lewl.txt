post-launch, relatively early on, I'd like to give myself a tattoo with a knife and some ink. On my forehead (a la Inglorious Basterds) I want to carve: d3fault. Similar to how I did with SLIPKNOT, except with a knife this time... and adding ink in both at first, and every time I pick the scab (which will be every time, just like SLIPKNOT :-P).


WHO GIVES A FUCK


Yes it's a publicity stunt of sorts, but it also demonstrates my devotion.


Also idiots might try to put me away for it claiming insanity -_-. Fuck em, I think they'd fail since I'd be 24/7/365/x
