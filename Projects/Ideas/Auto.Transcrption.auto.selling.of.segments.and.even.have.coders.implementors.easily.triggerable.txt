chunked (by time?) segments that balloon rise in amount i'll pay for a transcription starting from $0? that alone attracts users, who are then shown ads and the collective sum of how much i make in ads will probably always be more than what it costs for the transcription + hosting of making it. the only thing lost on my side is opportunity cost. the material does not have to be interesting, i still want it transcribed. a proper economy would ensure the material was legitimately interesting, but the economy currently implemented is random and lets math run rampant. i could literally just spew bullshit.
i shouldn't have segments when i'm sleeping
and i should have approved verifiers who settle disputes (i get multiple? 3? opinions)

anybody can report an error in the transcription and it will tell me who fucked up and i can stop using them for transcriptions

i can/should outsource the managing of all of this transcribing
i just want a data feed to myself of all the things i say

...i also want them categorized, and possibly even implemented. maybe just 1 finger flick says "implement this" and it pools my resources/peons and gets it done. i have algorithms to use the laws of supply/demand autonomously
