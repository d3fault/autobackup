If you are using "DevOps" and have N auto-deploy targets, it makes sense that DURING DEVELOPMENT phase, each time you click "compile", the kit/deploy-target is "incremented" to the N+1th (wrapping back to 0, ofc) deploy-target toolchain, even if it's a cross compiler. This gives you the benefit of "making sure the build works on all platforms", but cheaply. You don't have to recompile for EVERY platform every time you hit build, don't have to run N continuous integration servers, etc. Build object caching is implied, but would lag a little. Still, full rebuilds won't need to happen.
