once i get fingers up and running i say "ok you know what this means? time to go camping"
and then i walk out and ride my bike (to make it seem cooler) off into the desert
i record the entire thing

but i say to my audience: "see you in 3 days. buy me necessary components to stream 24/7 if you want to come along next time"

the 3 days is a target for battery life. perhaps i won't make it? solar power ensures i do?
