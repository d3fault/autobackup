"Waiting for <subdomain.brainwash.message>.youtube.com..."

could easily code it to generate messages
subdomains are free/cheap to generate
and even feeding a list of "next subdomains" or whatever for the next segments of the video is easy too

shit youtube's current random characters could even be brainwash injection into your subconscience
you bastards!


i was thinking of doing it just for fun "hello.viewer.how.are.you.youtube.com" for example
you could even factor in their name/username
system is system is customizable as fuck
i r coder
i want abc (or at least SOME project) to demonstrate just how easy it is to brainwash and spy on you
everything should be public
YOU BASTARDS
