a social networking operating system
anonymity, security, freedom of information

a living operating system
"social networking" is a buzzword anyways
living because you live on it + it is always growing


how much pb would it cost per day to have the world (7 billion atm and growing hellafast) recorded 24/7
let's calculate this using scene regulations on compression and lengths of works
let's put 700mb at 1.5 hours
to make it easier on the maths, 1000mb for 2 hours
12gb per day per person
84,000,000 gb per day for the whole world
wow a metric fuck ton
84,000gb is 84tb
so 84 million is 84pb
ROFL
per day!
30660 petabytes (millions of gigabytes) per year at xvid quality, random bullshit numbers chosen as starting points

i'm a dork
it needs to be distributed and have no single point of failure if i want it to always stay online
