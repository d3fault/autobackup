a list of packages that is known to yum and it checks the current directory for that package (does more than just a string compare as "qt" would false positive on "qtbase", not getting all of qt like intended. if the packages are not in the current directory as .rpm, then they are downloaded using yumdownload. this way, your packages themselves do not have to live in the synchronized repository, only your user settings (including the installing scripts) scripts are. also your data(???). the point is that your applications are always up to date if you just delete them all and re-login-fresh without any cache. your username(????) triggers your settings and the bootstrap script (in which you gave your username?) processes your list of shit to download which definitely includes apps (builds a cache like described earlier) and might include your data? maybe references to your data are lazy loaded? like you can load a dir and the dir structure is lazy loaded to you. saying for example if the data was on the repository. the repository should also store the apps... but i could implement a good deal of this easier using yum scripts
