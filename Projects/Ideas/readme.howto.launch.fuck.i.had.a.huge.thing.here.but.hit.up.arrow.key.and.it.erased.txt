had this idea before programming vague
cd-r (specifically not rw) that closes further writing (pretty sure that exists, if not, i can set/sign/verify an index at the beginning of just my files). the cd-r contains all the softwares i need to stay in sync with the dht on whatever operating system i want. it also contains an operating system for every one of the large architectures (x86, 64-bit, arm). same with apps for each. ACTUALLY NOT. you keep the application in source code format (Qt etc) and compile a cache on the local machine. the source is sync'd with the dht. it can be modified whenever (put on dht) but is not the only copy. a) you cache the copy too b) your peers have their own copies + also branches (though there is a giant shared master branch (and the author has a branch which is followed by default (which is how i get users to follow my branch of d3fault by default. the framework/spine that is d3fault that supports all of the inline-editable ones is itself inline editable. you right click anywhere in the background and can do "edit". so i'm going to have a windows-in-windows gui by default i guess i just decided. i need to in order for there to be a background PLUS it transitions very nicely over to "OS mode". the menus and all but obviously not the close/minimize/maximize buttons)))
the cd-r can burn itself and i use an offline computer to verify the file diffs between the files in between burns. the only thing that is allowed to change is binaries but only when i want them to. the source changes incrememtnally obv. i just do a tri-diff with the old cd-r, the new cd-r, and the dht repository. all 3 of their source codes. the new  cd-r and dht should match, indicating no adversary injected source code. they could of course inject source into your dht copy but that would then be visible to everyone [unless it's private in which you give up that priveledge]. you commit to the master branch by default unless there are conflicts at which point you can branch or fix them. i do in fact commit to d3fault and then to master. or vice versa. there would eventually hopefully be a team (or at least a single trusted maintainer, per project) in charge of each 'master' meh actually this idea sucks
had some groundbreaking ideas while just writing "diff 2 cd-rs on offline computer"
i may/might/want-to use offline arduino adapted mode if i can think of one that's as safe or safe enough~

the cd-r builder lets you decide for what architectures you'd like your personalized installed application [list, which is linked to source stored on dht. the list is also stored on dht durr] to have binaries built for. for example a good selection would be x86 win32 binaries. seeing as cd-rs are readonly you can use that to access the dht and use a 1-time password to evade any existing keylogger. game over for them. instant security wherever you go. assuming the dht is write-only, the most they can do is put some bullshit up in your name, which you can deny come verification process (how often? the idea is every once in a while you checkpoint your 'timeline' of shit in the dht to say it is in fact yours. and whenever you get hacked you start a new timeline but can symbolically link it (given enough of the ex-timeline-user's friends saying it is in fact you). this will be a fun as fuck project to do live. especially since it won't work. i should code it to be functional. security is used but is not guaranteed. in fact the entire fucking god damn network will probably collapse and data will be lost for good. because of this i should a) keep an offline copy of all my shit BEFORE it hits the net and b) occassionally download the entire network (lol? hopefully famous last words <3)) and store a copy offline (the content is our goal... but the supporting structure would be nice to REFERENCE too. note the dht should not need to be constructed/live/online to be able to access the pulled/backup/mirror'd data)... or right away if you watch your own stream.

jesus christ i know exactly what the fuck i am doing


rpc impl
paxos abc
launch abc simultaneously with d3fault?
no, before.
make money, possibly go to prison
launch with?
hmmmm.....
launch SOON AFTER
god damnit i hope i dont' puss out.
launch... when.... ready (what if i never am?)

perfection is the enemy of the good
perfection is the enemy of the good
perfection is the enemy of the good
perfection is the enemy of the good
perfection is the enemy of the good
perfection is hte enemye of the good enough

fuck man i dunno lol wtf am i really gonna be THAT fucking balls deep in a mere matter of seconds?
5meo-dmt is the only way srsly gg
have to be ready though
to land it
it's like a kickflip
pretty much~



jump up in the air, spin around as fast as possible, land back on the ground
pretty much describes me launching with 5meo...
i think i need the 5meo
for confidence
but what if i just end up being a druggie loser failure?
ok uhm
i KNOW for a fact that i won't.
because i KNOW for a fact that what i am attempting is in fact possible and that i am capable of doing it.
i just need to do it
not a matter of time
a matter of DO
DOOOOOOOOOOOOO
mother fucker
do you like your life?
sitting here inside n shit
DO
you know you'll get the largest energy boost ever by being online like that
you'll want to do everything
you'll live a fuller life
maybe shorter, but fuller nonetheless

so what are you waiting for?
23 is definitely old enough
maybe too old imo
might as well give up
accept defeat
lol.

i've still got some kick in me
especially if trained physically, which includes improved nutrition
i don't want to be buff but god damn i want to have energy to run and to stay awake for a full day. been so damn tired lately i feel like i'm slipping into a permanent coma day by day the days are really getting shorter i don't think i'm just seeing things and like 1-2 months ago i randomly started drinking coffee DAILY as if i was dependent on it all along except i mean i fucking hate depending on it ya know but shit been so tired lately can't help it. i wonder if it's a larger health issue. either way, don't i need MONEY to pay for medical bills? there's no way i could put that on my parents. i don't think i'm that sick, but WHAT TEH FUCK DO I KNOW. i am not qualified to make that call.
but
i digress
the kick in me is real
it's just 1
but that's perfect
1 is all i need
if i run out of projects, HAH.
hahahahahahahaahahahaha
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
owned noob old as fuck steven you just got shit on by yourself i hope you're a bored ass motherfucker. (most likely you are dead (this doesn't make sense. i guess it would be when everyone else finishes my projects?))
srsly bro there's a huge market just in advertising + 100% open source + free licensed (CC) content stacks. i could very definitely probably open source the advertising code too. maybe just under gpl? idfk. isn't gpl good enough? yes unless you want to incorporate it into a product. so a stack with mine would need a commercial license... but someone could legally use it to make money in their own business, so long as their business wasn't redistributing software with my code in it (and even then, they'd just need a commercial license)
so basically i'd be 100% free (as in libre) but i'd just make enough of a living off of the advertising revenue + the ABC business model (source of which i release under a special case: gpl. most of my other shit is LGPL [i hope. this is a case by case basis thing anyways]). i could also sell the abc code as a commercial license, and maybe one day lgpl it

the task itself sounds so fun
but i need to do it in the right order
i want to capture the creation process of it all

ABC
"Launch"
"Make..." (fingers somewhat relatively early on hopefully, and use it to control the "window within windows" d3fault "core" that is itself inline-editable. make sure (or at least try to attempt to, within reason) the default gui can be controlled by fingers (with + without video (audio instead, or vibration. but what about none? capture only mode i guess (btw should still have a way of telling you when you enter/leave that state so you know when you're recording or yea that state switch my bad idk one of them..)))... ok i was going to list other ideas here but i mean you get the idea i have shit tons of them. i also want to get adderall at some point
