once launched, at least with supporting infrastructure, i can/should hook caydon up with a dance channel/station
let him dance and collect all ad revenue/donations
i'm sure he could make a worth-it amount before he's 18
he might even be able to support his mum
but i mean what am i talking about making him the next michael jackson?
i just want him to do whatever he wants, for fun
and make money

does he like dancing? he seems to... fuck it
