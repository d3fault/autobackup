i'm not sure if sharebees is doing this, but it appears so (could be my imagination)

but anyways

for free file hosting site

like linear/exponential speed decreasing if they download too much shit in a row



like maybe 300 kb/s (my target is fast enough to stream x264 720p without stuttering. 1 mb/s is wasteful)
for the first file/700mb
then like 250 kb/s for the next if it's within an hour or some arbitrary number

all the way down to what my sharebees is getting atm rofl: 10 kb/s


just pause from downloading or buy premium and your shit goes back up


this is a shitty solution (file hosts sound like they'd require them to be profitable imo), but is superior to "hourly download limits" and other throttling mechanisms

so a user is never denied a file... they are just allocated less bandwidth.
