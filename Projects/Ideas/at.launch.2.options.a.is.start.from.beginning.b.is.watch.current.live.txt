Facebook post (for kaylee ;-)):
Launch: http://d3fault.net

or: I made this: d3fault.netafsdlfjasdlj whatever


the point is

when you go there

you are presented 2 options (intially, during the beginning) before you start watching

a) start from beginning
b) watch current/live


i think i should answer 'the meaning of life' (even though i already know the answer: none + HAVE FUN + 'get up and dance' (also actually do it this time. harperactive kthx)) at launch



and also, those 2 options will not be the only ones
later, i will add:

c) watch from where i left off (implies username w/e)
d) watch only interesting since i left off (tagged)
e) watch only interesting since beginning (ditto bitch)



god damn i'm sof ucking samrt my brain is going to esplode
