Obviously before making a purchase (or attempting to make a purchase), I need a utility to check that my balance is >= that (without showing me the actual balance).

Similarly, I should have a day "spend rate" vs. "receive rate" for the last 10 (N) days, and I should adjust recurring payments (without adding them all up ;-P) so that "spend rate" is less than or equal to "receive rate". Obviously it would be difficult to adjust spend rate so that it just about equals receive rate.... without my subconsciously/etc adding up spend rate so that I now know how much I have :(....... BUT doing so does mean that I get my money's worth. Would be stupid to die with money not spent.

Maybe because of that, it's perhaps only important that spend rate stays below receive rate, and I only look at recurring spend rate items when choosing some to delete (I might still accidentally add them all up during this procedure :-/)...... I'm not sure if I should sort them by amount... because that'd make adding them up easier (but it'd also mean I have less items to remove in order to get to <= spend rate). OH DUH maybe I can sort them by price but without showing what the actual price is! Just my knowing that the ones up top are worth more won't give me THAT much help in adding them all up.

Another dumb idea I've definitely thought about but haven't yet written: reverse 'linear' rates. Like, "eh I'll pay someone to tie my shoes before 5 days from now, the max I'll pay for that is 3 bitcoins"... then the system starts at .00000001 and goes up linearly to 3 bitcoins over the course of 5 days. Dumb/easy (well, as easy as ABC isn't proving to be), but would be ridiculously handy for just about anything/everything.
