4 objectives of "the most boring and necessary show -- ever"

1) defeat shame
2) defeat paranoia
3) solve world hunger
4) solve political corruption

edit: not really an objective per se, but 3 side-effects of a 5th 'thing' (goal? project?)
5) music fingers
  a) copyright issues with playing songs i like
  b) last.fm stream EASILY brainwashable
  c) 'music is brainwash. make own music = problem solved' (applies to even mp3s on hard drive, not just last.fm)

i want to make music, there is no doubt about it. by putting myself into 24/7/365 music output mode, i will _EVENTUALLY_ learn to play at least DECENTLY... right?
