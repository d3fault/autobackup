bootstrap the planet

because 'hack the planet' can and will be used to make me look 'evil' by the media

they are essentially the same thing
but bootstrap doesn't have a negative association

i should chant it/rant it somewhat early on after launching


maybe it is my 4(5?6? i forget now) goals
like, the TITLE OF

you know?



Bootstrap the planet
step 1: destroy paranoia
...etc





but those don't fit that well
bootstrap the planet is more software related imo

i mean sure, to ME, getting rid of paranoia will help me code/live better

but the 'bootstrap the planet' is really the mission of the d3fault software stack (hmm i quite like that, 'd3fault software stack'. still use the domain d3fault.net of course)
improve communication, possibly privacy (perhaps eradicate it? i know i am choosing to for myself), transparency, automation (world hunger fits here), etc



oh and it might also be a cool/good domain to get... bootstraptheplanet.com or something. fuck it
