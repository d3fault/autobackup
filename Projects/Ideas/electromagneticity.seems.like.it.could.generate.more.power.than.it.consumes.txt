isn't it possible to build an electromagnetic motor that powers itself?
the electricity required to "flip" the electromagnetic polarity constantly (to keep the motor spinning) stays constant but the size (and therefore power generated) of the magnets can scale up indefinitely? i could be wrong about the power staying the same as the magent size rises. maybe it cancels itself out.
