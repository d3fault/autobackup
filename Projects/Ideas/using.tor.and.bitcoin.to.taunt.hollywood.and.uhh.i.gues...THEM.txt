i could set up a lawn chair in an empty yard and then have people build a movie theater around me including the screen itself
i never open my mouth but i am typing. behind the scenes, i am using bitcoin + tor to get things done for me.

when recording, i simply say "i have the right to record myself sitting here facing this brick*(?) wall (wherever the movie goes (lol typed "whever"))"

they'd have to factually link me to the crimes
or a jurty woould lol jurty jusry would have to be convinced by a loweer lawyer* rofl so baked and yea that wouldn't be ahrd ta at all


my lawyer just gets up and says:
"my client did not ask for any of this. the burden of proof is the accuser's responsibility to prove that i asked for it"

idk fuck this idea sounds too risky

especially if i sat there for a while eventually i'm bound to get shot in the back of the motherfucking head
