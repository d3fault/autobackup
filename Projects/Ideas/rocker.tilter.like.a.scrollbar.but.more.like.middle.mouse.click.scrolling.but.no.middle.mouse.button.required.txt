facebook's timeline view sucks because it doesn't have a better method of scrolling it. and it doesn't predictively loading the data. see: google reader

google reader, if you scroll slow enough, you won't ever hit the bottom (unless you go all the way to the first post)
facebook you have to scroll all the way to the bottom, which triggers a load

i think a click and release to grab onto a floating object over to the right. this is very similar to the scrolling bar, except you 'tilt' it. when you click again, it releases the  tilter rectangular object (like scrollbar but not) which goes back to the middle (steady) state. this way you can set it to whatever sliding rate and have insta-slideshow mode everywhere you'd normally scroll. you should be able to view your lists/nodes horizontally and vertically, using the rocker for both. horizontal is possible in vertical mode (would only be applicable if wraplines was off) and at the same proportional rates despite not moving on the screen nearly as much. when you max out (in vertical case it would be top/bottom screen, but in horizontal case you'd be at the right edge) o wait i am basically talking about the middle mouse button :-/, except accessible as a gui item via left click. mouse button is alias for this rocker. there is no "4-arrow-directions-up-down-left-right" arror wherever you middle mouse, it simply disappears and you control rocker as though you left mouse clicked on it. actual mouse position can be preserved and restored upon second middle mouse (or left mouse. definitely either of them should take you out of rocker mode at all times)
