use TX line of arduino mega to another arduino (uno)
2 pairs of arduinos, 2 pairs of raspberry pi's

they are only connected by the TX line
save on offline raspberry pi
publish online (no need to save... but maybe a 2nd copy??) on online raspberry pi

i can physically disconnect the two at will also
but a TX line can only TX...
can/does serial work with TX only?
should in theory... idk about practice

obviously my usb serial is software control of TX/RX.. the lines are integrated

but doing a jwh-22 (lol i think that's a drug but i mean a fucking jumper cable) from TX mega to RX uno *might* work

uno is cheap, pi is cheap
doubles power tho...

can only be when within wifi that i have it on

syncs/catches up on wifi i guess
