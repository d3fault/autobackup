i need a snapshot of the freebsd + Qt + all of my own data (ALL SOURCES TO COMPILE ALL)  on paper tape or punch cards for emp safety. i need at least 7 of these for nuclear safety. the one on antartica should be a secret. might as well throw in the north pole too, assuming it doesn't melt away (does it?)

added later:
i love this idea and i love it under a 100% (LGPL && BY-SA) + non-intrusive-ad revenue paying



i need to make the one in antarctica be self-sustaining indefinitely. connects to a satellite (hopefully my own) and transmits data. as long as that satellite is up, it accepts infinite backups. this makes no sense. infinite hard drives? glhf



if i am on a cruiseboat 24/7, all i need is solar energy to communicate with every "neighbor" (haven't fully explained this context yet) satellite. i prefer my own but in the event that they are blown up, surely using a 'neighbor' is better than nothing at all.
oh and i forgot to mention the best reason to be on a cruseboat 24/7: nuke proof
unless you become nukeworthy~
in which case it doesn't matter where you go so long as your location is unknown to all
does that mean i run in the face of danger?
i mean fuck.
if they got nukes and so do i
i still shouldn't use them.
tactical strikes are always the answer
but what if i got jack shit?

what if they got a nuke aimed at my forehead and i got a mig to fly around for fun because i'm an obnoxiously wealthy businessman/hacker/guy

well i'm not wealthy right now / yet and i 'm already obnoxious adn i enjoy it anctaulyy it's kind of annoying.

Should I aim for the 100% perfect presentation ambition?
Should I try to appear presentable?
Should I try to blend in?
shit's ez yo
