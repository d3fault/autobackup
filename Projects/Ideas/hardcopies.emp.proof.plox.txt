i need a snapshot of the freebsd + Qt + all of my own data (ALL SOURCES TO COMPILE ALL)  on paper tape or punch cards for emp safety. i need at least 7 of these for nuclear safety. the one on antartica should be a secret. might as well throw in the north pole too, assuming it doesn't melt away (does it?)
