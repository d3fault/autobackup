progressive knee clapper

got this idea for a torture / information extraction technique while playing with my nephew caydon

he's 5 and nimble and jumped on the ground straight onto his hip

I thought about how I used to be able to do that, but now I would probably bang my knees together on landing and it'd hurt



so onto the device


a chair with your legs strapper to a machine that claps your knees together

an arduino controlled motor claps them once every... 10 seconds? the interval is irrelevant

it starts at a soft clap, but very slowly/progressively gets harder and harder

it could last days. weeks. months. etc.


so anyways, they are presented with the truth.. a question... and a button...


the truth: "pressing the button and answering the question incorrectly will magnify the clapper 1.5x"

the question: <whatever you want to extract>

the button prompts their response. you can be in a remote location and listen in only to the moment directly after the button press



if they're tough enough, they will slowly over the course of a long period of time experience their knees shattered together repeatedly


anybody knows hitting your knees together like that... 'perfectly'... is soo fucking painful (even softly)

the device would have to ensure that perfect hit

precision bondage etc... holding their knees exactly where they need to be


man i'm fucking cruel

pretty sure nobody else has thought of this :). yay coined my own torture technique copyright 2012 steven/d3fault
