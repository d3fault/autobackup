5: insanity, caused by 3

i am definitely shameful
i am definitely paranoid
corruption definitely exists

the combination of the 3 causes, is causing, or will cause: insanity

so defeating the other 3 has a side effect of [hopefully] defeating insanity. almost wrhote defaulting lawl


and another thing, though completely different: you think clearer, more exact, when 'live'. less likely to jump to conclusions etc becaues you know you're being watched/judged/evaluated and errors will (yay. this is a good thing) be pointed out to you
i'm not aiming for perfection, but reasoning through your own livelihood is best done out in the open, so as not to land in some isolated/insane area of thought (like i guess where i am currently?)
