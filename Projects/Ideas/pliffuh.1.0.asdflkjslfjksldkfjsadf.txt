I imagined myself already launched when I thought of this, thinking/talking to my naked self in the mirror:
penis helicopter arduino motion sensor + "fingers" (on left hand), guitar

My right hand is helicoptering my flaccid penis, and a accelerometer/motion sensor is attached to the tip of it. Each helicopter revolution is a "strum" on the guitar. My left hand is held out like an air guitar and the positions of my fingers is what determines pitch/whatever-the-wording-is.

"Penis Helicopter Life is Fucking Awesome 1.0"
or, PHLIFA... rolls right off the tongue. (Pronounced: plihffuh)

I began laughing hysterically when I thought about it (I just got done reading the article on "Satire" for research and because I couldn't remember the formal definition of it -- it was my attempt at satire I suppose and I didn't think it would be so awesome that I'd actually use it)... and couldn't stop laughing so I decided to actually do it and write it down so I don't forget. It will come post launch ofc, so holy shit I need to launch ASAP because tbh this sounds more exciting than fingers itself (even though it utilizes it).

Downside: if you become erect while playing, it will cause discomfort and difficulty playing
