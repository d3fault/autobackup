laser tripsystems before the motion detector in the "door area"
lasers are in the single path leading to the door. if lasers are NOT triggered a few seconds before the motion detector in the door area, it is made note in my notification of their presence that they skipped over/around the laser tripsystem. it has to be a secret for it to work.
not sure if i mentioned this already, but i could monitor multiple houses. they'd all be "mine" and i'd allow certain people over at certain times but only with me in the trunk the entire way. or in the back of a van with a living room in it. limo cept those are too expensive. suv is good enough really... with one of those retracting covers for the trunk items... except bulletproof (as is everything else). but it should not appear to be bulletproof.
