i like the idea of publishing boooks as well because they are an indestructable (well, less destructable) medium
they are distribution at it's best

sell a hundred thousand books... that's a hundred thousand copies :-D

they think they get a copy

but really, the copy is still yours...

should you ever be censored and need a backup

you have a hundred thousand

and the idiots will even pay you for it~

this world is backwards.
