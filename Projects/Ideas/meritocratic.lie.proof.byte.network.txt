you cannot receive unless you also give
your up must match your down (and then some?)
you are given a few mb/gb to start, but you are mirroring all kinds of documents. it doesn't matter if it's the same 1mb document 1000 times or 1gb document 1 time. you are credited for your bandwidth contributed
the idea/hope is that most people will upload a fuck ton more than they will download, if they leave their comps on 24/7 of course
this holds true most of the time, but not always
everybody's 'work' is verified and it is immediately flagged and delt with when an issue is detected
most people, by implementing a download/upload cap and keeping them equal, will never make it so their download is more than their upload. they will always contribute.
still even then most people wouldn't match their upload if they did it 24/7 for a month even downloading as much as they wanted
an internet server provider provides internet. they do not define or dictate what the internet is.
