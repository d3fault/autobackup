a library that uses this protocol above for storage alone is called the d3fault-packet. lol way too many 'd3faults' already my mind is going to explode

the encryption layer stripping could be foreverfilesystem
the inside packet could be the d3fault data. protocol, if you will. but also file storage (infinite for everyone).
i want to create a verification system where every once in a while you are asked to perform a random hash on the file. the truth would be the only acceptable answer and
