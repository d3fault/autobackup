i could get a gravity tester thingo that just points up always ya know that i can measure via arduino
as i rock from one side to side (do i know which was i am swaying? i don't think so).

but the idea is possible somehow else:
rocking side to side like tilting or whatever shifts your hands on the keyboard
this while you're using fingers
the effect is like the same as the computer
this can be accomplished with a motion sensor, in most modern phones and available as attachment for cheap for arduino
