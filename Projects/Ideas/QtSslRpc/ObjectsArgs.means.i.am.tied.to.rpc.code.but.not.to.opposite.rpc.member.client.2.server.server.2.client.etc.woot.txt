but wait, doesn't this make it strongly coupled?


well yes

but not to each other
only to the rpc code!

which is PERFECT


back-end can still be swapped out
and of course back end is strongly coupled with rpc shit


and front end is a USER of rpc shit,
so of course it is strongly  coupled

however, the client does not depend on the server, and vice versa
PERFECTO DESIGNO
