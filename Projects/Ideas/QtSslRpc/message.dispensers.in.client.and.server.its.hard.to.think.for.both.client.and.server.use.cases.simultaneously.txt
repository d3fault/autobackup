to what i said earlier about never needing Actions dispensers
this is only true for the rpc server

the rpc client behaves the exact opposite




Rpc Client
-Needs Actions Dispenser
-Doesn't Need Broadcast Dispenser (messages are arguments)

Rpc Server
-Needs Broadcast Dispenser
-Doesn't Need Actions Dispenser (messages are arguments)



bingo


so it does make sense to have a "BankServerMessageDispenser", that just has "actions" and "broadcasts"

client gets what he needs (action dispenser)
server gets what he needs (broadcast dispenser)
