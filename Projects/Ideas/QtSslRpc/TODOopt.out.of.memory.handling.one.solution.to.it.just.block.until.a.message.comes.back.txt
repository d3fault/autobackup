an optimization / worst case scenario code path (might be too costly to
implement) where if i am unable to 'new' a message (out of memory), i only make
sure that 1 was previously new'd... and then i block and wait for that old one
(or any of the previous old ones, doesn't matter... just need 1 though or else
we fail/error out)


might be possible / cheap-enough seeing as i don't need to use an atomic
or sharing etc for a bool waitingForMessageOutOfMemory ... since ::get and
::recycle is on the same thread (well, my current code isn't, but working on
fixing that)
