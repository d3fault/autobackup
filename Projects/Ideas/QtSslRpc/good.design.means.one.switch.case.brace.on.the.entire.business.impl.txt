basically, a good design only has one switch/case usage segment when dealing with multiple messages
you only need to do a switch/case thingo right after you read the network message header
then you read in the rest of the message onto the message itself, and then emit the message to teh business impl
it emits back, and each message has it's own code path

we might be able to combine code paths right toward the end, the writing back onto the network

but there should never be a reason to do another switch on the message to figure out what kind it is again
