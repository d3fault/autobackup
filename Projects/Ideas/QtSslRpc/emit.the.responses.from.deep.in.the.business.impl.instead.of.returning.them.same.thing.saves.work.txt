Random idea I just had: instead of returning the responses, maybe i can just emit them back?
would keep the Bank impl cleaner, no marshalling around types and shit

AND, it's already do cross-thread operation... we're just making it simpler.




so we'd have like a CreateBankAccountArgsObject request;


then we could do:

//for other types we'd set params on the request object itself

emit request.responseReady();



better example, with setting params:

GetAddFundsKeyArgObject request;

request.setResponseAddFundsKey("asdf");

emit request.responseReady();



there is also of course


emit request.responseFailed<Reason>();



and you'd prolly need to do a return; right after each one
since you're not longer returning the objects themselves
