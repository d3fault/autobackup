rpc server backend objects need to take ownership of and keep a reference to
whatever dispensers they require

they dispensers also need to know of the rpc client server helper's

each message new'd by that dispenser. the QObject *parent of the message as it
is being new'd is the rpc server backend object that takes ownership of it)
