prior works
patent prevention


that's the best benefit for releasing minddump

fucking patents are stupid

two people come up with the same idea
whoever patents it first gets all rights to it
fucking retarded

by minddumping, i ensure that nobody can steal my ideas, patent them, and prevent me from doing them (laaaaaaame)

my prior works are pointed to and i say "i came up with the idea first. here's proof"


but i mean i'd still possibly have to worry about proprietary ripoffs

i'd just have to battle them by funding free versions
or do it myself

lots would take my ideas and proprietize them


the second best reason for releasing minddump:
life is too short for me to do all my ideas. i need/want halp



a big concern is also: stealing/hacked/spying... THEN patent'ing

minddumping prevents that... removes the ability to steal/hack/spy

fml paranoia sucks

can't wait to escape it
