doing lighting is difficult, tedious, and very important for designing a 3d environment that users will navigate
the best way to do it is to play it. in dev mode or something, but using the game engine
and you can set lights around everywhere
'make everything around ME more lit up' (incremements of 5, 10, 25, or "TO-MAX" every time)
'make that area i am looking at lit up' (incrememnts)
'make that are darker' (increments)
etc (make everything around me darker too)

the lighting is of course saved and is that way for all future users and your revisits
"the d3fault lightmap"
it can either be 100% bright or 100% dark, but why not 50%? that would be the best d3fault
anybody else can edit their lightmap, but then it's not the d3fault... it's THEIRS
anybody can select an alternate lightmap
OR, a game/changeset/branch? can specify a lightmap (which is just a revision?) to use

the 3d geometry is the same all throughout
the lightmap and 3d geometry must be separated... pretty sure that's possible.
