distributed stable internet by means of telescoping the internets to me from like 20 different general directions while i'm like on an overlooking mountain or something. those 20 points would each need to be sending a video feed of themselves and their surrounding security using motion detection. maybe like on a second story floor in each. since i'm watching the house and the only open window is being used as a telescoping pointing system to give me internets at a distance (mountain) and the surveiling + automated-software-monitoring-of. i can program it so that if my radius is broken, i drop thermite on my entire setup. if thermited before the tresspassers see and/or figure out the setup (i am still recording/surveilling from that location, just eradicating the hardware in charge of forwarding the internets telescopically. there needs to be a clean/unsuspicious dividing line in the code so that it appears as if the house (the stuff that stays online and keeps on surveilling/uploading to dht) was only being used as a server (tor? custom dht? either way, i'm physically hiding under the server doctrine is the point. flushing my anon packets with the tor server. this will cost a lot to set up, but it is doable)), i am ok and can continue using the others from the same location. i wonder if someone could see the internet telescoping like with a special light detector or something and could graph a 3d model and see it pointing to my mountain house. i would have internet there too and would use it as normal. email/bullshit/games
