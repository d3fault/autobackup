to detect orientation with ease, you simply determine whether the width is less than the height. i'm using a monitor right now and it would be good practice to make code that works both in landscape and in portrait mode. the easiest way to detect this is to just use the desktop resolution. i don't think desktop libraries/toolkits have Orientation::Portrait etc like mobile does. this kills 2 birds with one stone.
