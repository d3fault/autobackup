timeline
there is unixtime and there is data
title is optional
if it's blank, unixtime is used
there are no two pieces of data that occur at EXACTLY the same time
it is impossible
because time can be infinitely precise
randomness can be added to give the precision we are unable to calculate using modern computers

a block chain (a la bitcoin) can be used to store the data and it's integrity
the 'block chain' is all of the data(????) or maybe at least just all the hashes????
a 'daily ad' can be incorporated into the block chain, and users who donate their bandwidth/cpu receive a fair cut of it
this is the block chain daily ad
there can also be an ad specific to individual content
so we reward the server providers
and the content providers


only on such a system with anonymity built in (bitcoin does not currently have this)... 7 layers of encrypted proxies etc... is data secure
it economically drives itself
it becomes an economy in the traditional sense
it also is a currency muchlike bitcoin (except on it's own block chain)
i am unsure if i am able to implement it... but i am sure that it is possible

this after/during watching history channel einstein
i guess i do fancy myself a genius
but i have no proof of it (hah!)
