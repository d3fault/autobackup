a meritocratic voting system in a private/business environment (so we'd have to respond to dmca notices) where people vote (and the system responds) on whether or not something is what it claims to be. the uploader is just the first voter to cast a yes on [whatever they upload]. they can upload anything and claim it is anything, but as others view it and agree/disagree with them is ultimately what decides what it is. every variation (rename) is logged, and the timestamp of when the rename happened, as well as a snapshot of the vote count (agree/disagree) as it happened, is logged too.
