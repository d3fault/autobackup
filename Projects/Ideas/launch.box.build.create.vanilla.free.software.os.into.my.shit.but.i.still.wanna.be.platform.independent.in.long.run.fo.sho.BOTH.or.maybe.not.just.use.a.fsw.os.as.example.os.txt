i can/should make a 'launch box'

i mean have the design for what i'm going to do planned etc so everything is
smooth...



but really, record the installation of an operating system and everything that
goes along with it. record video-wise...

...then code the motherfucking on-system recording shizzz

launch OS

whatever

i mean it isn't something that'd be special

but would show how2doit


it would be even better if i accomplished it + documented it with 100% free
software

a 100% free software OS :-P, which there are plenty of






complications would arise during the downloading/compilation of h.264 / x264
the libav copies of it

but i mean... we could generically NOT-exclude it
you know?
never mention it

as long as it's free software, i'm game
LGPL is good enough... so....


i'm not sure what license would need to be paid??

a script mimicking my launch box (created + documented the creation) could do
it for the user too. at that point, am i breaking h.264 patents? i'd call
bullshit.




i could always take the 'safe' route and explicitly exclude patent infringing
codecs... but i like the apathy route better...

this is all getting away from the point


i'd like to even visually record myself building a thumb drive of the OS in
windows mode...

then plugging it in and installing the os

could call that video "breaking free" (of windows, for most)
"breaking free" doesn't apply to me... i just choose windows because i want to
appeal to noobs... and linux users can obviously already build thumb
drives........
