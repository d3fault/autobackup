finger potentiometer board, all 10 fingers
right hand (dominant hand?) is vowels index.. 
in combination with left hand, is letter index AFTER said vowel indicated by right hand

ex:
right thumb alone is a
right thumb + left thumb is b
right thumb, left index = c
so on and so forth
right index is e
right middle is i
right ring is o
right pinky is u

there are extra/unused characters... for example right thumb + left ring/pinky (left ring would be E, but we do vowels on the right)

it actually fits just perfectly aside from that
z ends up being right pinky left pinky
weird
ALMOST AS IF IT WAS MEANT TO BE
except i don't believe in 'meant to be' bullshit
just a coincidence
