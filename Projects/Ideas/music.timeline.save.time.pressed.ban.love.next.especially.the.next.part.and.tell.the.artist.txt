my music app can/should not only scrobble but tell the author/artist at what point the user pressed "next" or "ban" or "love". what point in time on the song

cloudsong does it wrong. fuck comments (though allow them in their respective categories). 

a lot of "next"ing could trigger toning down the frequency in which the song is played. like a playMaxEvery8days or fuck i don't know how long
