i'm thinking about releasing a book asep
called 'minddump'

not asep now
but asep after launch
as in, prepared before launch

like this:

code abc

code launch (move out. set up)

code/organize book (minimal, just prepare for lulu)

it's called minddump
perhaps 0-23 (or 24 or whatever age i get around to this shit)

it is everything.
in a book.
for sale.

also for free
on the coded shit

and i just pick up

and i can do 1 more every year (i plan on increasing productivity a hundred fold)

so minddump 0-23
then minddump 24
then 25
etc

technically that means this will be in the book
