I want something sort of like a fanny pack but not as big (but in a different way, bigger). I want a bag that stealthily looks like either my abdomen or a beer belly. It should be usable with a regular t-shirt, providing the t-shirt bottom reaches the pant top and we wouldn't have "shown skin".

I want this not to conceal things from the police, but to conceal the fact that I have a bag from the store clerks.

Being a guy who carries around a computer is a pain in the ass. Cops have the right to search your pockets, but stores have the right to refuse service to anyone wearing a bag! The only good solution is to deceive the store clerks. I am not a thief, this is not a bag for stealing items.

Sometimes you just have to operate on a different level. The stores have their reasons; so do I.
