if i decide to go with the 'hide some things' route

and perhaps code tor hidden services WHILE streaming myself

i should do it in between respawns while playing a video game

and i could write it off as "i am instant messaging" or whatever the fuck i want

plus it gives them something to watch other than a blank screen while i'm coding on another hidden/offline one


still, it's harder to focus and get shit accomplished using that multi-tasking technique

less questions would come in (lol do i even accept input? decisions decisions)
