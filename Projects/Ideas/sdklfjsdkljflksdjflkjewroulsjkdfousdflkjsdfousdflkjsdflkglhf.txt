re: "fuck noobs imo". the tradeoff between safety and performance. i agree for the most part that performance should not be sacrificed for safety, but i think we can solve a metric fuck ton of the safety problems in the IDE. if i don't explain this right, 1337 d00dz will laugh at me, but it's something along the lines of "a coding session, when quitted, does memory cleanup that you forgot to do". To say that the IDE inserts "delete" statements into your code is absurd (isn't it?), but that's the sort of thing I'm getting at. Basically "as the app is running" you get the "no safety performance", but eh like dis is IDE/framework/etc dependent: exit points can "know" (either from debug runs... or just being damn good at static analysis) when memory is being leaked and clean it up. So rare is a heap object forgotten to be deallocated actually desired to remain in memory: those cases should excpliticly call for it. Memory leaks should not be the default, BUT I agree completely that "us" (;-P) 1337 d00dz shouldn't pay a performance penalty because of n00bz. File under feature for designEquals (though it doesn't have to be), as that seems fitting...
