It would be real fucken neato if you could use either a compiler switch or even a runttime switch to determine whether or not memory is dynamically/lazy-allocated/on-demand vs. pre-allocated at application launch. The first would be for regular OS usage on desktops etc, and the second would be for RTOS and embedded systems with limited resources. pre-allocating makes it so the app will tell you right away whether or not it doesn't have enough memory to perform all of it's functions.

This applies to visual widgets memory allocations, and also buffers used in backend/business stuff.
