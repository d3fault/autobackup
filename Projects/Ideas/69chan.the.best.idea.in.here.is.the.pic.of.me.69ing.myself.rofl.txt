69chan
basically just a better version of 4chan, probably in Wt
static, no deletions (cept cp)
on the "about" or "contact" page, there is a photoshopped picture of me 69'ing myself
cawk goes in mouf
i(we) am(are) horizontal, not vertical

then an arrow pointing to me saying "this is your god now"
or like "this is the admin of the site"

the title of the entire site (not just the about page) is "because moot is a faggot"
i can change that later though....
Wt/Ajax, maybe even a native client

DHT would be pro but you're getting ahead of yourself YET AGAIN

AdCaptcha for posting, AdDoubles on pages (or maybe not... since AdCaptcha is shown on every page anyways... why have 2?)

fuck moot
fuck 4chan
not complicated software at all...
