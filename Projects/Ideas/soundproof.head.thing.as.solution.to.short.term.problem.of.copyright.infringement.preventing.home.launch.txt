Folding in half and clamping/mounting onto a backpacking backpack, soundproof and mirrors covering both inside and out. Just enough room for your head. Video cameras on the outside feed to screens on the inside. Two screens could be placed in front of the eyes, and fingers impl could be used to control the direction each is facing (incl almost 360 degrees (except feet) if designed right), left hand controls left eye camera-rotation (had:screen) and vice versa for right. It solves copyright infringement issues. My dad watches a lot of proprietary media. Loud.

I think the mirrors on the inside would actually be worthless at the size I'm wanting (small). If you're too close, the effect is harder to see. But I think maybe it just depends on how close the screens themselves are to my eyes (I'd imagine they're simply mounted on the wall, but maybe I'd push them in forward more (actually that sounds like a terrible idea and the screens would end up going through my eyes, so leave them flat at the very least))).

The problem of oxygen arises :(, how2soundproof+oxygen-in. I would think any airhole would let a lot of sound in+out (more concerned about in). I could speak (+record), listen to music (CC-BY), make music, code, etc.

It's a silly problem of logistics at this point, but this solves it (if I can get oxygen figured out :-/). I am certainly raging and getting closer and closer to suicide, but the closer I get the more stupid shit I'm willing to try/do. If I must launch from home, I must. Sucks but no other choice. I am wasting time that is more precious than I realize.
