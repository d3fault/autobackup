CTRL+SHIFT+R in Qt Creator.... on crack
Should rename all usages in all projects in all [submodule] repositories on a developer's hard drive (or "autobackup" etc folder).
HOWEVER, when doing the symbol rename, you should be prompted as to whether or not you want it to apply to projects linking to submodules that are pointing to earlier revisions.

If they select yes, the submodule should be intelligently updated so that the only thing that changes is the symbol (the code is still FUNCTIONALLY equivalent).

They should even be given the option to select whether or not to change the symbol on a per-project (rather, per-submodule-link) basis. Sometimes a lib changes drastically over a few commits so that symbol rename makes sense (but does not for the earlier commits). I guess you would have a slider selecting which revisions "before" to leave the symbol un-renamed and "after" to rename... and when you move that slider different projects (submodule-links) are visualized as "changed" or "unchanged" by the rename
