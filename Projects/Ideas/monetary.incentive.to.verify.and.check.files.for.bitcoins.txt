the data is shot up like a waterfall and the servers are paid money to collect them and deliver the decrypted data
i don't know where i'm going with this
but like a:
private launch on a piece of simultaneously-public launch of application
whilst spamming their "inboxes" on said application with decryption keys (they have to figure out which piece it goes to... forcing them do download them all)
they get paid for just checking as well
