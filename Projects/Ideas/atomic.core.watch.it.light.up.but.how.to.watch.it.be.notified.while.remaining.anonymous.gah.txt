the problem of an atomic core
an atomic write
biggest problem in dht

i hate terms like 'eventually consistent'
barf


seeing as it's a finite amount
and it's like a web
you can unfold the 'web' (of nodes) into a plain

and if your write is sent to the network and the entire network as a whole verifies it in a predictable manner on that plain
you could watch your data light up the plain
or the orb
or whatever shape you choose
after seeing the majority of the orb (online/trusted users (servers?)) light up, you know your data is safe
