Me floating (perhaps laying back, though not necessarily) on a puddle of women, them holding me up and/or in place. My fingers are rigged with fingers implementation and are controlling electrocution pads being worn by the women holding me. The electrocution pads are placed specifically over the muscles that contract to get them to walk in the direction I want them to go. I am steering them. I use any arbitrary steering mechanism, including auto-pilot (the humans use common sense as they walk).

We can probably all communicate (I mean, I'd still want a sound proof room for myself and each of them, but we should be able to communicate therein (as in the entire fucking system))). They are nodes, I am node, every use of it is just a node. No differentiating (duh).

Making robotic versions of the same thing (common sense while walking actually not possible with robot if/until (err just until) AI is created) would be the best solution. Best because then everyone could do it. The common sense robots (are us) would probably want to do it also, so it would be impossible. I would have to take advantage of some of my fellow humans to even do it [with common sense auto-pilot "go in direction 137 degrees for 5 miles" (might as well daisy chain those (had:thoughs))], but I know people would be willing to do it (especially for money, but even for free).
