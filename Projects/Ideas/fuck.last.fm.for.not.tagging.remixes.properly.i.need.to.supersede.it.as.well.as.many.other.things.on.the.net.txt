subtle remixes are the enemy
i fucking hate when a last.fm song changes ever so slightly but the artist / song remains the exact same

i've banned plenty of songs that i actually enjoy because of it
sometimes it's just a completely different version
sometimes it's just a slight remix and i feel like it's trying to fuck with my head
just like some beats are slightly off

i remember a bit on TV about alzheimers patients being able to tell when a note was off from music they listened to as a kid
that shit sticks.
