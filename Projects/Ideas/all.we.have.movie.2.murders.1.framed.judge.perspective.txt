"All we have"


A movie where the story focuses on a judge's perspective of two separate murder cases, but the audience has a godlike view of all 3 stories (case 1, case 2, judge's point of view). Case 1 is an actual murder, case 2 is a framed murder. From the judge's perspective, the cases appear identical (both defendent's lawyers make the same exact defenses, there is similar/same evidence, etc). It should accurately portray our current judicial system, which is "all we have".


We cannot trust words we cannot trust testimonies we cannot trust evidence we cannot trust anything.......... but if we don't, there is nothing left to go by. It is all we have.









It should scare people
Random additional thought (probably shouldn't be in the movie, but I guess _COULD_): Filmings yourself 24/7/365/death is a good alabye to keep yourself from ever being framed.
