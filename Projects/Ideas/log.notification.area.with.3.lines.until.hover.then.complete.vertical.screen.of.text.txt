a log/notification area
3 previous log messages are shown
they live at the bottom of the screen
i'm thinking bottom right
on hover, the 3 changes into fullscreen
that is, as vertical as it can go
straight up
not getting any wider
ONLY ON HOVER
you can click/drag/copy/paste the text from there of course
and scrollbars too
move away, it goes back to 3 log messages. 3 could be configurable, but 3 by default. errors would be easily seen, as well as just notifications that aren't worth getting all IN YOU FACE like a messagebox too
