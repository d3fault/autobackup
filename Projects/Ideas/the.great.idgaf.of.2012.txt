the great idgaf of 2012
i should go through and release <whatever i feel like>
[don't use](PRIVATE_UNPUBLISHED?)

i should basically just tag a whitelist of "idgafbook" which will be published definitely on the site and maybe in a book. why not?


here's why not: because it will take a long time to do and because i need a db keeping track of what is released and what isn't. and since i've written this i have decided that i don't want to hide ANYTHING. i want to be in 100% truth mode because then my brain will be on perma orgasm mode (and especially when i trip)
