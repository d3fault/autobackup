Fun little small idea where you put a kite or pole up maybe 3-10ft above your head and perhaps with an 80 degree tilt or so. At the top you have a camera pointing down at you and then in front of your face is a screen showing that video. Nothing fancy about this idea and pretty simple, but I've never heard anything about it elsewhere. Caydon indirectly fed me this idea asking me about games where you're "in their face" and I explained to him what 1st and 3rd person means.

You'd have to balance aiming downward and forward depending on the terrain. Grassy field I think it'd be most enjoyable to show mostly top-down (80 degrees), but walking anywhere you'd probably want to show mostly in front of you. Also, wires and trees etc would pose a problem and you'd probably not see them coming. Would be cool to have a mode where the camera stays in one orientation (even if you need gyroscopes and motors to keep it facing one direction) as you turn (like some videogames do), but would probably be easiest if the camera swung around you as you turned (like most videogames).

This idea reminds me of the putting video camera on your heels idea, except would be way less tiring (hell, you could even combine the two ideas rofl).... or even do eXtr3m3 sp0rtz while wearing it (snowboarding comes to mind, mainly because of a dream i'm about to write on the subject)
