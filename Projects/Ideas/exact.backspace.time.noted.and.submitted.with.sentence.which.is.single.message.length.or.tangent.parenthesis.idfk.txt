the exact backspace time and the exact time for the key that you backspaced should be noted, and when replaying should be replayed at the exact speed in which it happened. this being in the middle of a sentence being displayed at the sentence-average-cpm. we scale our cpm to meet the backspace-time-accurate-incident which is a node that belongs to the sentence? there can be multiple per sentence of course. and what if i backspace over a sentence? well then i guess that sentence is gone. and what if i don't use sentences? i guess you sort of always do. at least human communication always does. this is not meant for machine writing. it is capturing human speaking/tpying. even code has statements. you could do like evaluations too. one set of open/close parenthesis is one sentence. similarly, one assignment statement ( x = 1; //ignore these parenthesis (this comment is also it's own 'sentence')) is one sentence.
