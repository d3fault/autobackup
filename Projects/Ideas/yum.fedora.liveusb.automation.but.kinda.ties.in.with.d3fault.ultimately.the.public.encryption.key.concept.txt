i want to use basic encryption (built-in-encryption?) to mount an archive from the usb drive as read-only
in there is my install files (cached) + scripts (which cache, although being in readonly mode kinda fucks this)
but more importantly, my plaintext passwords for last.fm, pidgin... and i guess eventually some sort of public encryption key (this is used in auto-sync'ing of pidgin logs to some server, for example)
basically i want a vanilla live usb when no password is entered
and then customized-to-shit + my-apps-installed mode after i enter that password
