i could answer my doorbell using text-to-speech

the doorbell speaker decrypts it using my public decryption key

so me and only me can broadcast from anywhere worldwide to my doorbell speaker anonymously (though, if they're at my door, they kinda already know who i am)

still, answering the doorbell is a requirement of not being robbed

i could monitor many many houses simultaneously
