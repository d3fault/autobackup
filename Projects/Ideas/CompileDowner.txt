CompileDowner

given a Qt app (that is, an end-user app written using the Qt toolkit/framework)
aka, given a project
Compile with lower and lower Qt _Versions_ until you determine the Qt version that is earliest(lowest) to compile. this is PROBABLY the most portable.

actually fuck this idea sucks because security implications have to be taken into consideration. and besides distribution packagers will [attempt to] compile the project in whatever Qt version they DESIRE (aka "stable" in Debian terminology).

however CompileDowner still has use in the "compile and distribute _binary_ to 'app marketplace' as [sometimes paid] package for [sometimes mobile] OS". in that case, finding the most portable is more desireable than finding the most secure. fuck security on app marketplaces, because fuck proprietary-allowed marketplaces! if I can't have the source code and an adequate copyleft license alongside it, I don't want the binary. fuck off. as a computer user, needing the source code is a manner of sanity. don't even get me started on it's implications to computer fucking programming.
