MusicFingers was always the codename. wasdf is much better (although maybe harder to say?). but really more importantly I was rushing like fuck when I was coding MusicFingers. I remember being stressed the fuck out and sweaty and blah. I want to rewrite with a calm head and stick to cleaner code and correctness (but obviously copy/pasting and referencing MusicFingers a ton). MusicFingers was also.... too music specific (as the name implies). wasdf is going to be coded more properererer: it's a kb/mouse substitute and also a musical instrument. my target right now is simply: realtime calibration with feedback. after that I'd imagine the next step is "mode choosing/switching", but I might be wrong (and calibration might have a 2nd step: analog pin to finger mapping (coded 2nd, but obviously it'd need to be presented to the user before regular calibration).

renaming now helps me keep the rushed code out of the non-rushed code.
