I need to realtime replay my serialized wasdf actions (the raw user input stream) on a different computer, then overlay the mouse--- scratch that, compare the sha512 of the screenshots of the computers (every GUI piece must be deterministic (and that's pretty ez tbh)). but anyways the original idea (involving mouse) was that I need to overlay the mouses of the separate computer(s) to make sure they don't get out of sync. like I mean the leonardo/micro "special" (real?) usb channel might get out of sync with my KeyboardAndMouse "dupe" channel that is getting sent over the Serial port. If the different channels of KeyboardAndMouse input [streams] get desynchronized and not corrected (and the differences would likely multiply as time grew), the entire serialized user input becomes useless. The serialization has failed (save for maybe keystrokes. I guess yea this is about mouse. but that's the thing, the mouse controls a TON of actions on the computer [that we want to be replayable FROM that user input stream].
