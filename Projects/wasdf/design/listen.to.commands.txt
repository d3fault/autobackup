I should play, with smoothing (akin to autotune), the frequencies of the commands.

It should be a toggleable mode, app-wide. Every "plugin"(?) (module?) that runs commands has the audio for that command played, but first run through a normalizer to make it sound halfway decent (otherwise it'd sound like white noise).


The state of each finger is recorded in time.
-Commands are run from gestures
-Sounds are played from the movements made to form those gestures with your hands

^both are reproduceable in a timeline. you can save space by having them both refer to "the state of each finger as it is recorded in time".
Just also have 2 modules that react to finger movement position changes that the core emits.


If I "play" (listen to) my commands, I think I'll hear patterns. I can then go from there.
