overloads. i think i was unable to differentiate between function/method overloads as of yesterday.... but now that i've got libclang compling and FUCKING WORKING (<3 <3 <3 <3)... that is no longer the case. I mean off the top of my head I could easily write an equality operator for a "DesignEqu--Function" type, comparing each param type along the way :-D....
