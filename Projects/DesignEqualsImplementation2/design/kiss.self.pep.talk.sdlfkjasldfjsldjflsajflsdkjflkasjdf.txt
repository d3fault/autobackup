I've decided I'm not going to do any project level instancing (so no cli/gui generators just yet), only object member instancing for now. The left-most class lifeline is heretoforth known as 'this'. It shall be seen as such: "Foo *Foo::this". For now, it may only invoke slots on child members (until I allow a pointer to be passed in). Signal emissions, and connections thereof, may only be between that 'this' instance and/or any of it's child members. To want to refer to a project level beyond that is falling for an infinite recursion dependency problem. Ultimately, project (cli or gui) will be made up of a class. I will hack it out of the already existing class code that I am describing. Or actually perhaps it will be a completely separate gui and concept that I have not yet thought up. Perhaps wizard based.
