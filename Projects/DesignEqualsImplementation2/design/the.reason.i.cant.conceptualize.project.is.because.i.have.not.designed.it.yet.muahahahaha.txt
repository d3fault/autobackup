When I hand code, "project" is usually directly dependent on cli _OR_ gui, and not both. This is not good, but I do it anyways. Maybe that is the solution I am trying to find. Maybe I should stop sitting and thinking and trying to design designEquals so hard (in mah brain mostly, skimming the source)... and I should just instead modify the 0001 target so that "project" is no longer cli/gui dependent (cli/gui should implement an interface (unrelated side note: interface (pure virtual abstract base class) is ambiguious with lots of other uses of the word (user interface, for starters))). Yes I believe that is it! Fuck yea the start of this doc I had no idea that I'd solve the problem finally. Oh the value of mind dumping.
