For quick add line edit, still unsure of the way the user should specicy that return type or arg type is/was "defined elsewhere" (such as a 3rd party lib type). Hackily, I could tell them in the tooltip to do "typedef int SomeTypeDefinedElsewhere;" hackery. Slightly less hacky but also requiring more clicks (and therefore time), a modal dialog could pop up (only when > 0 new types detected) and each new type detected could have a radio button "yes make internal class" or "no it is defined elsewhere". Default to "yes make internal class", but remember the defined elsewhere type if they select no (so we don't bug them about it again). In most situations, the dialog pops up and you just press OK without even looking at it because you know you want to create the new types.

OT: there could also be a "whenever this defined elsewhere type is used, make sure this header is included (so the type is known)". The header include in that case would be just a textual string and not a special type... it's the user's responsibility for making sure that header path is correct and installed on the machine etc
