On one hand, I want to only generate a class once. On the other, I want to walk a slot's occurance (whether define or reference) as many times as it appears and in as many use cases as it appears in. Use case walking is for connections statement determining and resolving only. Classes-in-project iteration is what is ultimately used to generate a class. Their processes are similar (iterate list of statements), but their actions differ greatly (connection statement resolving vs. class definition/writing).
