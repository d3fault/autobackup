Answered my question on whether to use the libclang types directly or to continue reinventing the wheel: I am not able to instantiate a "FunctionDecl" directly without supplying a metric fuck ton of args that I don't even know how/where to get or populate. I only know how to use one that the recursive ast visitor gives me already populated. So derp gonna continue reinventing the wheel :)
