Connecting actor to Foo::fooSlot does two things: it makes fooSlot the starting point use case, and also defines fooSlot or a reference to it (depending on whether or not it has previously been defined). The use case may very well define tons of other things much beyond fooSlot, so to say that the use case IS fooSlot is incorrect. It is at a minimum fooSlot, but may and probably does contain much more than fooSlot alone.
