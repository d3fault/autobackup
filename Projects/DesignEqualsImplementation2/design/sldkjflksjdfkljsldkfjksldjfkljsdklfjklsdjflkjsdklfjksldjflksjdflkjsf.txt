My point with the three characters abc earlier in a doc with 2 entries was that the overhead of the meta object system is negligible compared to the fact that it's functional, properly designed (rather, designable), thread-safe, and asynchronous (synchronicity being easily attained from async). I doubt that in 99.999% of my projects that the overhead would be a concern. Most of the time that is not the concern.

I can of course produce optimized and non-portable generated-code that only uses the meta object system when threads are involved (such as in cross-thread calls). But it is better to default to the thread safe version, especially when there is run-time deciding already implemented. This is an optimization that I try to keep out of my head. It simply isn't worth doing yet.
