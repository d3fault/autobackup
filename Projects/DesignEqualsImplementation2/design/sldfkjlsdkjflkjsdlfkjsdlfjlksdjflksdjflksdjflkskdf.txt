It boils down to this: top level object connections are "generated when the app wants them (because a use case wants them)", but connections between a class and his child are MORE permanent (they should still not be 'hardcoded' so that they can be moved should the child be unchilded).

It's difficult to focus on both "one project mode", the logical starting point, and to also make sure I don't do anything I'll have to undo later for "multi project mode"
