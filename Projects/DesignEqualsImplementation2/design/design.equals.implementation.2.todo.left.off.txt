-Auto-Layout both when a project file is loaded, and whenever any action occurs that mandates auto-layout (such as connecting a slot to a signal, a slot invoke from one class lifeline to another, etc). Do it "unefficiently" (leftmost class lifeline top->bottom, then work your way all the way to rightmost class lifeline top->bottom) without any logic determining if the class lifeline is even relevant to the new change. Optimize later. The "change" auto-layout should be the same as the "load project from file" auto-layout, for now.
