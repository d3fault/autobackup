Kinda sad that llvm/clang requires C++11 in order to compile, BUT so does QtCreator, which designEquals is going to use for C++ editting. As long as the output of designEquals compiles under C++98 (and it does/will), I'm fine with this. Maybe later I can hack in some compile time switch so designEquals compiles under C++98 (no quick add, and use notepad for C++ editting), but fuck it low pri)
