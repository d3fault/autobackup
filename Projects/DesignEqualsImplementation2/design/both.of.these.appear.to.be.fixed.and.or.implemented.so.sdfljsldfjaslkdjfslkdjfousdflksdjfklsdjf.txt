0) two foosignals in header. problem is in generator code pretty sure, may be in invoking logic
1) bar is completely wrong. instance needs to be chosen is part of the problem. still a case that the gui should not allow, handleBarSignal was invoked using invoke method and "this" was used to refer to foo (from within bar!)
2) "signal checkbox tooltip": "to be able to invoke without a signal, make the destination a a property on the source. it should have a source-Signal-sender-object hasA dest-Slot-receiver-object relationship". then when they have that relationship, we allow and default to invokeMethod. the signal is simply unchecked, but it is still checkeable.
