There are two ways to define classes (although both ways create different aspects of the classes): Class Diagram view obviously creates the class, but use case view defines the slot bodies (and implicitly where signals are emitted therein). However, the role of the use case view changes when at source generation stage: since the classes (slot bodies) have already been defined WHILE DRAWING THE LINES, iterating the use cases at source generation is only used for determining where connect statements go.
