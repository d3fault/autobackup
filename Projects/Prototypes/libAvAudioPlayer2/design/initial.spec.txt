the purpose of libAvAudioPlayer2 is to simultaneously prototype:
a) curl buffering / libav usage of a file in memory (instead of hdd)
b) to see if after modifying the code to load from memory, mp3s will work as well as .avi files

i should have an interface that the curl downloader implements
the same interface can also be implemented by a hard drive file loader

IMediaStreamToMemoryLoader

class CurlDownloader : IMediaStreamToMemoryLoader
class LocalFileOpener : IMediaStreamToMemoryLoader
