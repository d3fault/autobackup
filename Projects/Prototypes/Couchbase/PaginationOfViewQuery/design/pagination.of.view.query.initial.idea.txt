I'm new to views, all I've done with them so far is query them plainly once (then display the resulting json), no pagination etc. I want to prototype pagination first, and then second I want to try to implement the "more efficient" method of going to the next page as described in the couchbase docs. I can't even remember exactly what it was, something about using a a null unicode character in your range start thing or fuck idk.

The point of this is to get me ready to implement the "Users with Ad Campaigns for Sale" page on Abc2, which will mark my first real use of views.

I may or may not additionally prototype a "5 minute view query cache", since views are expensive to query (but I'm certainly leaning towards putting the cache feature in Abc2 ofc)
