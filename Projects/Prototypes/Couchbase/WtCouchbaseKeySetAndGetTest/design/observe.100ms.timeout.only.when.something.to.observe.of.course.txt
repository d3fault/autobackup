because I don't give a shit and it's good enough:

store callback triggers:
libevent 100ms timeout for "observe"
-unless the 100ms timeout is already 'active' [by some other store], in which case we just add to queue that the libevent timeout uses to initiate observe

observe callback schedules next libevent 100ms timeout for "observe" [if stores have since queued themselves for it OR if the keys we are trying to observe have not replicated]




I don't need ridiculously high (err, low*) latency. 100ms is plenty fucking fast for a human and for the replication process to hopefully have completed


bool observeTimeoutActive; //store callback adds key just stored to observe queue no matter what. if this bool is false, initiate 100ms timeout using libevent and set bool to true




disregard that. mfw "lcb_durability". sometimes documentation is almost more important than code
