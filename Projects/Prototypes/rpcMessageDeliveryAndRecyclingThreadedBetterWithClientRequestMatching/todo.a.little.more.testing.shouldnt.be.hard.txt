i need to make sure that threading works right when my impl backend hands off a
dispensed message to a brother/sister impl backend (bitcoin to
dbhelper(dbhelper provides synchronous access to couchbase via hasA
m_CouchbaseDbHelper))

i need to make sure that deliver() is NOT called from the bitcoin thread
(should be from the db helper thread) and that we still receive the
deliverSignal slot on the network thread

i can't see why i wouldn't, but who knows


my m_Bank will make the signals between the bitcoin backend impl, the dbhelper
backend impl, and then from the dbhelper backend to the (NEVERMIND BECAUSE
DELIVER() just emits a signal and takes care of itself. we only need to hook up
the hand off from bitcoin to dbhelper.. then dbhelper calls deliver() like
normal...
