no it does not so you should use a messageSize shit in front of each message, and make sure bytesAvailable()

but you also have to make sure sizeof(typeof(messageSize)) > bytesAvailable() too :-P




and of course, to get each message "aligned" (for lack of a better word), the first part of the message, before even the messageSize, is the magic... which we read in one character at a time. we do this in case we get un-aligned so our protocol fixes itself :-D. robust as fuck.
