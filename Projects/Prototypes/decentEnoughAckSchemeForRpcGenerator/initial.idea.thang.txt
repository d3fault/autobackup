re: /RpcGenerator/design/MESSAGE.TRANSMISSION.ERROR.USE.CASES.and.also.the.typical.success.case.need.to.study.and.solve.this.txt

this prototype is based off of everything accomplished in there


AND i am including the following thoughts on the subject:

holy fucking shit i am aiming for perfection
i am being retarded
i just need it functional
"tcp is good enough for most cases"
THIS IS SO FUCKING TRUE IT ISN'T EVEN FUNNY
your ack layer on top of it is just extra frosting

you CANNOT guarantee shit like you want
it's just fucking impossible

no matter what design you come up with,
the business always "might eat it"
AND the response "might not get here"

very much more likely that the request won't get there if the response doesn't

but i mean holy fucking shit dude you'd drive yourself insane trying to solve those
i mean shit you already are.



you're starving
not actually
but you're certainly driving yourself insane


OH MY FUCKING GOD ABC IS SUCH A BASIC PIECE OF SHIT

and you are deprived of everything you desire

which you have already planned
etc


until you "perfect" the design


FUCK IT

you will be hacked.

shit will crash.

with bitcoin, it does not matter [much]


as long as you're sending your coins to offline machine keys periodically/often
who gives a shit

as long as you advise others to do the same
fuck them if they get screwed
FUCK THEM.

you cannot trust your software
you cannot advise others to do the same
google/facebook/microsoft/paypal/etc all fucking lie
that is their business strategy
"we are stable/secure/etc"
fuck them.

i will tell the truth at least.

i want somewhat stability
and i will get it
because i'm fucking 1337


BUT this perfection shit
trying to solve PERFECTLY the functionality/design
you're retarded.

make it functional

there's already too much to code and too little time to live

code
