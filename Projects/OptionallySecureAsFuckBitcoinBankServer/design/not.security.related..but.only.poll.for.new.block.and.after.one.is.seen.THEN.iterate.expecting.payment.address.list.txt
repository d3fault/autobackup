Instead of polling every X seconds to see if a balance has arrived at a given address (or a list of balances with a list of addresses), poll instead to see if a new block has been confirmed (would be best if this could be signaled obviously). Only then would you iterate through the "list of balances/addresses" to see if any are relevant. Checking to see if there's a new block (especially if signalling is used (hack bitcoind)) is probably way cheaper (since this is a server) than using polling on the addresses-expecting-payment list over and over (pointless if there isn't a new block on the chain).
