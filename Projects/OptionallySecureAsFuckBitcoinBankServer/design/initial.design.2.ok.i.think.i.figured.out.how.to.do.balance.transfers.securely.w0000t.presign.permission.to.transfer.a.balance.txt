re: SecureAsFuckBitcoinBankServer balanceTransfer problem
pre-signed authorization by the user's private key to transfer a balance

could be for however long they want or could be for within a time range

if their account is in SecureAsFuck mode, they have to submit a 'permission slip' of sorts to allow the balance transfer

this is generated signed beforehand, but can be decrypted/verified/processed instantly by the server


a typical permission slip might say

'allow me to balanceTransfer 35 bitcoins'


....so really the only important thing is the amount


but i could get all fancy (K.I.S.S.) and specify who to allow the transfer to, how long the permission slip is valid for, etc....


this solution does apply to every other potential client (to the bitcoin bank server (server clients vs. user clients lol)), not just the ad agency.


oh and we're gonna want to use random data (and maybe their username) to pad the signing/encryption just because it's always a bad idea to encrypt something so small
