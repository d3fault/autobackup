I've been searching for the correct way to describe the following for a while now:
There's two "kinds" of callbacks currently being generated/represented/supported by RpcGenerator3.


Train of thought leading up to above: I made an Rpc Generator, you specify (nope:your rpc back) the kind of callback you want based on whatever you need at the time of request dispatch (from Qt or Wt).


Despite "rpc back" sounding shit, Remote Procedural Callback actually has a nice ring to it. I fucking un-abbreviated(had:un-acronymed) it for the sake of brevity.
