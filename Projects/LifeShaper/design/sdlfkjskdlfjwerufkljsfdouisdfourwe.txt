I am about to import the GPL into my working directory so as to conjoin it with the LGPL in a first attempt at a draft of DPL. I came upon the realization that the creation dates for the GPL/LGPL files (if I pulled them properly) would have dates much further back in time than the submission of them into git (and the INSERTION OF the file/timestamp in my EasyTree output). Somehow that is significant and worth mentioning, I have no idea what to do about it though.
