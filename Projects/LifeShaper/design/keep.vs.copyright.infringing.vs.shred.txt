For my LifeShaper.exe (which will process and whitelist all previous data (it's going to be a beast (i'm so scared i'll "leave something behind :-/ (so perhaps i should keep the 1tb archives around for a while (after blacklisting/shredding certain files lol)))))

The options for each data node are:
a) Keep / Use (reference in 'timeline') -- all my docs, but also the ones where i am musically inspired to new thought
b) Blatant Copyright infringement (reference in 'timeline') -- me dancing + lip'syncing to copyright shit
c) Shred / Censor (not referenced in 'timeline') -- everything else. use minimally


(a) Is posted on Abc "file hosting service" and additionally mirrored to Freenet for data safety
(b) Is posted to Freenet only, because I can't afford to lose the work, but also cannot distribute it because it is a copyright violation


perhaps that line (b) is actually "planning to commit copyright infringement" or something (almost put "conspiracy", but a conspiracy is between two people or more people so wtf? can i conspire alone? rofl wut?). I mean perhaps it's still illegal. I don't really care if it is, so long as my data is in tact and ABC is not raided. d3fault will then have somewhere to scrape from later on :-D (will probably mirror the ENTIRE web as well as all of freenet :-P and TORsites etc)
