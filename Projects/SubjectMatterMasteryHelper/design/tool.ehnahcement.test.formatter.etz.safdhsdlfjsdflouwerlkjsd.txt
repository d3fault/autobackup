Once all the various Q/A file (line?) formats are specified, another app (tool subdir?) could be used for helping to generate those files. As of writing I'm just doing question on one line and answer on one line, but if I wanted to be able to mix question/word-answer, multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, true/false... and lots of others stuff such as case sensitivity on per-question basis.. blah blah blah.... then such a tool would be very handy because the input file [format] would probably become cluttered and more machine readable than human readable (another tool could simply make it human readable again (spit out txt file human readable, or just present it in qplaintextedit (ideally such output could be read as input, which means the machine format should also be human readable :-P)))
