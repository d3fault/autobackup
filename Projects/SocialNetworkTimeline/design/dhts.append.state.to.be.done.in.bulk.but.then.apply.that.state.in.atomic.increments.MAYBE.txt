On a DHT, you can do fault tolerance+detection+realtimecorrection if you do "write what you're about to do first" then "do it", but it is more efficient to bulk together writes of "what you're about to do", when you can. While DOING each of the bulk mutations, each node in the DHT can synchronize the cryptographic hash of their dataset after EACH of the singular mutations in that bulk mutation. But just as easily they can wait to perform the cryptographic hash until all of them have been applied. Maybe what I'm trying to say is that bulkMutations are atomically appended to the dht's dataset, but then those individual mutations are themselves applied atomically (rather than "all together atomically"). Fuck I forget the point.
