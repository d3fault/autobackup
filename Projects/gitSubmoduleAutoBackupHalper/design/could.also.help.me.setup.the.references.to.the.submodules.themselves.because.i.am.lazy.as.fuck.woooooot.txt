the tool could also help me create "symlinks" (submodule references, which can be referenced infinite times and will probably happen a lot in the "Projects" folder for instance). It could be something as simple as "I copy the path of the submodule I want to reference" (in native file explorer etc) and then "I paste it into the app after also telling the app where I want the reference symlink to live (in a project heirchy (lol sp), for example)". Oh also probably need to be able to specify branch/commitID :-P
