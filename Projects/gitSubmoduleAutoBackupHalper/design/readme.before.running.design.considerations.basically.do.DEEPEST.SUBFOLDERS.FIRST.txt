this definitely is common sense, but the inner-most child subfolders need to have their "submodule" updated/committed etc first before their parent can then process their own folder (which includes updating the revision for the child that just updated). etc. a nice recursive design would do fine, but we just need to know to start at the deepest children found (TODOreq: since we use qfswatcher to only watch existing folders, new ones won't be seen until we commit (and of course next run). we still need to process the deepest children subfolders first even if they didn't exist before this run)
