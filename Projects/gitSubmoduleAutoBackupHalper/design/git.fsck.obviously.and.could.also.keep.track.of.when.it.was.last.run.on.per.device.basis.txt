Obviously it would have git fsck functionality and also be able to work with various external hard drives. I am not sure if it should be "smart" about them and give them IDs and remember them etc. It could remember "last fsck run time" and run it when it's plugged in, if it hasn't been run in [x] (or hardcoded initially (few months? idfk. i won't even sync them THAT often, at least not some of them)).
