I guess I need a bootstrap app that "unfolds" the long-term storage and also "touches" the datetimes for everything back to how it should be. But I mean I suppose this is/would/should be a piece of functionality of the main app, so maybe it is all one? Still would be a bitch to have to initialize all the git submodules by hand to have to dig out the app itself to then compile it to then let it unfold [the rest (or just scrap the manually-unfolded area)]. Keeping a copy of that app's source handy when doing an OS format would definitely be a good idea. I don't mind compiling it, I just mind manually unfolding.
