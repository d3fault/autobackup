Since in the long-term storage (the bare git repo from which the submodule points to), each repo will live next to each other and we essentially don't need to maintain the folder heirchy (we just need to know which one is the "root" repo (TODOreq)). We still need a way to know which is which though and since each one represents a PATH (relative to root), it doesn't make sense to use the path as the filename (no slashes in name). To get around that we could use a simple file that is text/simple and all it does it relates the path to some generated filename. Come to think of it we could just sha1/etc the root-relative-path and then when a submodule requests a path (hard to understand the design when factoring in "revision specific "symlinks"(really folders/submodules)) and then instantly know which folder to go in from there. Probably no file needed (but idk)! But if we did use the file we could/should probably also shard the sha1 keyspace a bit so as not to have too many folders in one folder because that shit just loads slow tbh.
