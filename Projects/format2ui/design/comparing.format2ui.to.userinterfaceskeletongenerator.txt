format2ui is about generating the code to set up the UI itself! what you see and [potentially] where you see it!
user interface skeleton generator simply was a code generator to SPEED UP the connecting between a UI (BUT IT WAS NOT GENERATED WITH ANY UI ELEMENTS IN PLACE, ONLY CONNECTIONS).

uisg and format2ui might merge someday, at least in some ways. maybe they'll just go hand in hand instead, idk
