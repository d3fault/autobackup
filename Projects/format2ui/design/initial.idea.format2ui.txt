ODR!

ONE DEFINITION RULE

I hate having to code 1x CLI ui and 1x WIDGETS ui. that's 2 fucking UIs!

Qt doesn't seem to give a shit about CLI, but I do.
Qt's QML is a disaster, but I am pretty sure I can/should still target it as an OUTPUT of this app. Qt's Widgets are outdated as fuck (but still better in some ways than QML imo).

ODR! QML could have be that "one definition", but it's inherent use of JavaScript is a show stopper for me. I don't feel like my UIs are ever very complex... just tedious to write.
Almost always a fuckin grid of widgets. a layout of layouts. horizontal vertical -> done. the end. simple as fuck. I can define that using json easily, I don't want to get way the fuck ahead of myself and bundle in some monolithic javascript interpreter, I just want a simple grid-like widget definition... which I then translate to CLI, Widget, QML, HTML (probably custom) etc. ncurses comes to mind.

there is a drawing on my whiteboard that sums up the EXACT train of thought perfectly, but basically the end result will look like this:

format2ui --qtwidgets /path/to/format.json /some/output/dir
then blamo format.json is converted 2 the ui of type qtwidgets, and those files go in /some/output/dir

the naming of this probably sucks, but whatever fuck it for now
