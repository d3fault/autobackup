there's a part of me that wants to call IUIGenerator *uiGenerator = m_UIFactory("--qtwidgets").... wait no I said this wrong. I want it to be a runtime switch and a single binary for both cli and gui. HOWEVER, it doesn't work because gui requires x11, reguardless of whether or not any qwidget (had: qwie) is instantiated/shown/etc.
so like yea idk the ui _impl_ could be based on an interface and instantiated on demand (failing back to cli query mode if istty returns true)... but I should NOT do this because then cli would haved to be linked against x11 shit (in theory it shouldn't, but in practice it does). fuck that.
