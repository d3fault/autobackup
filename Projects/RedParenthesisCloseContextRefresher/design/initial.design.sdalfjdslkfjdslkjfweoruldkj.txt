Red Parenthesis where current ones are large'ish without overlapping other letters* and they are auto-inserted as you type like Qt-Creator. The most important part: the 'context before' (say... 200 characters. It can/should-be/IS arbitrary and can even be user-defined. is also red, though not oversized. If there are other parenthesis in it, they are shown collapsed maybe or respect how user left them. or BOTH, though i am not sure how that would be done. the 200 characters limit skips over parenthesis sections altogether, so you only see THAT CONTEXT in red <- solution woot. It is meant to get you to be able to SOFTWARE-SELECT trains of thoughts and be able to remember all of them simultaneously and add to them as you think shit up? Almost everything is a derivative of something before it. It is perhaps even true that everything is a derivative and we only some of the time NOTICE it being a derivative.

If everything is a reaction to an action (well aside from wanting to know what the first action was), [lol paused here and realized that Red shit would come in handy] then we are all at least on the physical level, derivative. Definitely. We are chemical so therefore derivative. Consciousness, on the other hand... is definitely way more complex than reaction/action. Once self awareness factors into it, our brains override the action/reaction behavior that does not require brainmatterconscience to 'process'/occur.
Our brains process, the physical world around us occurs.


So the red highlighting is temporary until you start typing. You're either looking at the past by then or you know what to write. You do not need the red anymore.



onCLoseParenthesis()
{
	m_Highlighting = true;
	contexts.current.highlightPreviousXignoringParenthesis(int x = 200, QColor::Red);
}
onCharacterPressed()
{
	if(m_Highlighting)
	{
		m_Highlighting = false;
		//contexts.currentOrPerhapsEvenPreviousIfTheyJustTypedAParenthesis
		Context toDisable;
		if(keyPressed == OpenParenthesis)
		{
			toDisable = contexts.current.previous;
		}
		else
		{
			toDisable = contexts.current;
		}
		toDisable.disableHighlighting;
	}
}

This pseudo-code is clearly going in the book. I'm also going to code this right now. It will have a simple timestamp-NOT-OVERWRITING-hyphen-sha1.txt

If the timestamp and sha1 are matching, what the fuck?
I wanted to say it should reference the first one, but now I'm getting way too overkill. KISS. Can always change it later and even easily import it (<<<<<<<<<--------- FAMOUS FUCKING LAST WORDS (though it is ridiculously trivial in this instance))






mfw Qt Creator does the red "parenthesis expansion" animation on close parenthesis :-P. I like dat plus more permanent + context highlighting of characters too... duplicate work is duplicate
