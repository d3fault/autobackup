in the same sense that google created their own network, so to will i... whether i want to or not
for this reason i should have an index of all sites doing business with me

a combined list (maybe filterable by the two types) containing a) sites running ad campaigns on them and b) sites that are advertising themselves on others' ad campaigns
start building an index, watch it grow like a mofo. buy 1 slot, list 1 campaign.. you're permanently on the list forever i guess...
