the listener object will be disconnected from the bank helper singleton upon Wt session deletion
but that doesn't necessarily mean we don't want to update the db values still
we definitely still do
all it means is we don't want to notify the client via server.post
so the db logic/code should definitely NOT go in the listener object... nor should it have anything to do with whether or not the user is logged in/has a session active

all i am wondering is if i can access/modify/use the Wt db (safely?) from outside of a Wt WApplication session...
...if i can't, the solution is to use a Qt db
but i do think it will make organization easier if i keep them all in one db (with multiple tables of course)

the .user() (returns dbo::ptr<User>) call in the db code for Wt really just performs a .find using the username by string... nothing fancy about that
and i vaguely remember reading somewhere that i should instantiate 1 database object for the lifetime of the SERVER PROCESS... with each user-session getting their own instantiation as well. something about it making sure the db stays open/active/alive or something.
i might be able to use that server process instantiation of the db to do my bidding... i dunno lol
god, and i drank coffee for THIS? i was hoping for a coding day :(
