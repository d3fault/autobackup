when the time comes where i need to scale upward the appdb/appusernamedb server
i can basically just split the shit in half
an md5sum of say, for example, the usernames (or the owner's website domain), is first done
then the first letter of the md5sum is used to determine which server to connect to
initially, for the first split/scale, there'll just be 2 appdbs/usernamedbs
md5s have a range of 16
0-F
so 0-7 for the first letter will connect to server #1
and 8-F (15) will connect to server #2
it can be divided further as needed, and when all 16 are used up, we can then use the 2nd letter of the md5 sum
there should probably be a secret salt added to the md5 function (each wt front-end would need the same salt though) just so users can't game this and bring the any 1 server they choose to a halt. since they can generate md5sums for their usernames and keep generating until they get 'a' repeatedly and then spam created/login/whatever 'a' usernames to ddos. secret salt prevents this
