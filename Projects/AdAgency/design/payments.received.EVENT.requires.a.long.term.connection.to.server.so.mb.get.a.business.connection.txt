the payment received EVENT**** would in theory require the local 'bank' to make a server to the webserver...
even though with the SSL connection i currently have the webserver/front-end as the client and the local bank/bitcoin payment shit as the server. the webserver connects to it on demand.
2 solutions:
a) have yet another ssl server on the webserver just to receive events
b) leave the connection open 24/7

i don't like either one of these solutions.
a udp protocol would make this easier as i could just send the packet whenever the fuck i felt like it
still, i'd have to manually do encryption/authentication and handshaking and account for packet loss (packet confirmations)
FUCK THAT.

i'm leaning towards 24/7 connection
...except i'm planning on having this shit run in my house
off my home connection

aim/msn/irc are allowed to have connections open 24/7...
...what will they say about a mostly idle ssl connection to some random server?

obviously i'll upgrade to business connection once i can afford it

then again, i'm probably going to need some kind of investment money for the initial servers...
... so i can factor in investment money for a business connection too...
