rcpssl is built into the bitcoin client, i just discovered
at first i was like "aww man i coulda written way less code"

...but i like having the polling being local
i don't want to do an RPCSSL message for every poll
it'd increase the traffic a fuck ton
so there. i win on accident :)
plus i want to keep the bank logic (actual) OUT of the cache/front-end
