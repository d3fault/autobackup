The two security measures (sha1 proof (machine verified), render proof (human verified)) are completely worthless if the computer[s] (3) fall into the hands of an adversary. These two security measures are not meant to combat data loss/corruption/etc from humans, but to combat data loss/corruption/etc (bit rot, power failures, etc) that are expected by the eventual and guaranteed failure of every computer component.
