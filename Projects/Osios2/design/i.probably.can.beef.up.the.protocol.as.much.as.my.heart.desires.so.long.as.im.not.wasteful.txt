I will most likely achieve stable/calculatable speeds that fall far short of filling LAN bandwidth (especially gigabit). I don't need another port/connection for periodic images of infrequently changing widgets. Since I capture the core events (and not the stupid ones), I know exactly which widget[s] to re-render+transmit+associate-dat-rendering-with(since-it-will-come-back-with-the-timeline-node-cryptographic-verification-message)
