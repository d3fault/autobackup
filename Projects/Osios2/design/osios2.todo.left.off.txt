-[de-]serialization of state (a rolling hash id point). The timeline stream should mutate the state itself, and the copycat/verifiers should modify the gui based on signals emitted from the state changes (it would be better to code it so that even the "main"/controlling gui uses that same method, but qt widgets isn't really set up well for that. maybe i should port it to qml, which does admittedly have better separation of gui/logic even though i fucking hate that it uses js etc (another thing is that i'm not very familiar/comfortable using qml, and this is an app that requires i am fluent with the gui)). the state should be serialized at shutdown, deserialized at startup, and there should be checksumming and "playback" from "semi-old snapshot" whenever a checksum isn't valid (or playback from null if no old snapshots are available ofc)
