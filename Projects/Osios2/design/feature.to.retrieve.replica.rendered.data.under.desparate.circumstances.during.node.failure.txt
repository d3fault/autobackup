During/after node fails, there should probably be a way for a replica/renderer node to then "show" the not-shown widget that had been used up to then for rendering only. Maybe not and the better solution is to simply restore/fix/restart/whatever the failed node (and the SYNC/HELLO phase will put them right back where they were), BUT maybe the feature described in the first sentence would be of use under certain circumstances (no spare hardware atm to mend the node, etc etc). Perhaps the showing of the previously un-shown rendering-only widget could/would be read-only (in the "we just show a message box telling them it's read-only" sense, not literally setting it to read-only (or maybe yes)), but sheeit it could even take over as the originator too.

Such "showing" should be tucked away in some [debug? advanced usage?] menu or something...
