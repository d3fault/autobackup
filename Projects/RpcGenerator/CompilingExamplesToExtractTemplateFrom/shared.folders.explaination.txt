the client and server each have their own autogenerated folder
then there's the client/server SHARED autogenerated folder

both of those are specific to each rpc service

lastly, there's the global rpc shared, which is shared among client, server (hmm actually there should probably be a 'global server' and 'global client'.. but the point remains) for every rpc service as it contains no service-specific code
