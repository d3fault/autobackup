CompilingExamplesToExtractTemplateFrom
there is a script that has hardcoded the variables that needs to be taken out
and %VAR_NAME% done to them (can generate it based on the actual var name taken
out if you want or make me define it. first sounds easier).

from that, the template used when "compiling" (generating rpc that uses said
template) is used is used is used rofl what the fuck.

so i can modify and test the compiling version of my generated code. i can add
to the generated code as well as the extraction script as needed... but should
always have a compiling/working CompilingExamplesToExtractTemplateFrom example
before updating the extract script. and before running it (implied)

should also strip out comments so I don't ever accidentally add comments to the template version. The compileable version is the master copy.
