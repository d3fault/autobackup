ahh yes another thing is multiple servers and multiple clients
each form a cluster
or at the very least, have a cluster backing them as a shared db store (each is a couchbase 'client')

idk it isn't a huge deal but i have to remember it. if client fails to connect to server, connect to the next one

i don't know what to do with a response if the requesting client disconnects. TODOreq: failover mechanism? store user session in db and redirect them to another wt node? guess it depends what part fails really... could just be the connection from the client to the server.. but the wt app could certainly crash too idfk
