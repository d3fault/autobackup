I think Rpc/Abc needs to err..


I think my problem is one of high scale design

my "appdb" is now just a cache layer

the web server layer


bank db and app db are final 'copies' on the 'rpc server'
the cache is on the 'appdb'


so the ACTUAL rpc connection, where any CLIENT business logic goes, is all the way over in wt land (even if it's still on the same MACHINE as the cache / 'appdb'. each layer (client/server... or appdb/bank if you want to think old fashioned) has a set of couchbase clusters backing it. they are not running directly on the machines, but they are on the same LAN. There is a WAN in between client/server. Cox/Qwest/etc connections to my house form the server. We try to keep load down as much as possible. Client is outsourced web servers acting as caches only. It uses a "get + subscribe" method to read... and of course writes just pass through.



But this implies a stream log design which I have yet to come up with. Even worse, I have yet to prototype/code it. But at least I'm starting to understand my problem better. Stream log also means I can have multiple layers of verification/sanity-checks in place.


There is definitely a stream log on the server.

I do not know if there is a stream log on the client.



WAIT A MINUTE ORDERING DOES NOT MATTER SO SHOULD IT IN MY STREAM LOG? GUH SO CONFUS.


Have I bit off more than I can chew?

Should I just become an hero? I'll admit it's been tempting lately.
Should I just release books with nothing else backing it? I do think I could retire off of it. I have a shit fucking ton of substance. The only thing is I couldn't release on the internet with advertising because Google would censor me. Dear Sergei and whats-his-face, FUCK YOU. I fucking hate this world.

The only reason I haven't blown my brains out is because I've convinced myself that I can make it better. So much that I won't allow myself to do it until I've tried my best


....and I know I won't fail. Just fucking time consuming. I'm at A, I want to be at B.
