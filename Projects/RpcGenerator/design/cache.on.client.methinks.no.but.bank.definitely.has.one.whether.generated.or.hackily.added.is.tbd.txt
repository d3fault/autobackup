bank is a shit example/first because it is a contradiction
i say i don't want a cache in the client
but i definitely DO for bank
even if it's hardcoded/hacky
think of the "balance"
i don't want a request to the rpc server (bank server) every time the user logs in to their account (and there's a balance variable)

but for the vast majority of rpc shit... there is no caching


should i have rpc generator be able to generate in two modes (cache-on-client) or should i hackily add the caching ability just for bank server?

no fucking clue but it makes me understand at least a tiny bit why i keep getting so god damn confused
