in the generator app, i should be able to specify where i want the rpc shared folder to go. making it 2 directories "up" from where my project(s) .pro files are is good enough for now, but if i ever released it as a product it would definitely need to be customizable

the reason it's 2 directories up is because i have each project in a src folder

oh and also, the path needs to be updated in the generated source files under AutoGenerated*/
because they mostly reference the shared folder
