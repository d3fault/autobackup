the wt way of showing a generic error should be a: 500 Internal Server Error
that is all.

every hack detection should return that too...


...however it should ALSO write somewhere in a "hack detected" log ;-)

which i can analyze and possibly identify "unpredicted VALID user input" cases and fix code accordingly...
...but will mostly be useful for looking at all the adrian lamo wannabes and lol'ing my ass off :-P
