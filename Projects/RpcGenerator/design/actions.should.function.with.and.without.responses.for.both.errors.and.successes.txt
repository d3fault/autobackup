action no response && response feasible/forseeable



createBankAccount has no response whether it is an error or not (just success or error + enum)

it's feasible to think that getAddFundsKey's error 'useExistingKeyFirst' returns the existing key. but the success returns a new key also.


every error has an enum describing the error... but that's about it
