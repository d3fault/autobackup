an optimization: just like we can fail out servers and try another, it MIGHT be possible / make sense to fail out (on _ALL_ rpc server servers) for specific Actions. Like what I'm saying is if the business keeps eating messages no matter what machine I'm on (we CAN assume that if one's eating them, they all are (same code). but perhaps that assumption should be tested before we fail out the action? idfk), why would I keep trying it? Ridiculously optimized version of this would also disable the Wt GUI controls haha... but those are so far away it's not even funny (still do-able though!!! 'theoretically' (and I love exploring theory when I'm retired (which isn't yet, hence this is going in a fucking TODOoptimization)))
