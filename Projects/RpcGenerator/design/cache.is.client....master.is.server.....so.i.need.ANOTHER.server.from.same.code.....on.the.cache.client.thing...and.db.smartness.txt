My Rpc Generator is so fucking sexy... I just need an ack scheme... which means I need a way to deal with errors... which means I *think* I need a stream log... which means I need to integrate / be smart with the db... which means I might as well build in the "cache/master" shit in the db.


So basically I don't need to get rid of my current Rpc Generator code... I just need expose the SSL / networking portion of it.... again?

What I'm currently coding is just the communication between the cache and the master...
If the cache and master are tightly integrated (and auto generated), then there is no user code involved.

BUT it's not a waste since I can steal/use the code/design to just put a "server" (wt talks to him. wt is a client) right where my "client" (client is really just cache now) is



something like that




I hope to figure this out on that backpacking trip




I hope I don't bitch out or forget :-P
