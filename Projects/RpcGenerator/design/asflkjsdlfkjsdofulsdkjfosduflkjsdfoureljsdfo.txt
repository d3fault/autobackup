Since Rpc Generator copies substantial portions of itself to it's output (I would definitely make the argument ath the parts of itself that it copies are the much more valuable part!), I can choose what kind of copyright programs using the generated docs must use. I could also library'ize the output and release it under DPL to make everybody happy. Or I could PD/BSD it and not worry about the library/dll separation issues (like I have it right now [in an unfinished state]). It's been so long since I've written a library lmfao... I mean since I've told a compiler to spit a .dll out: I write libraries all the time :-P. Can't even remember how (why would I remember anything I could look up?).

I've concluded that the Business Pending problem is best solved by simply reporting the facts to the code using the Rpc Generator. Another middle layer could wrap Rpc Generator and solve some kind of FS-related WAL/etc, but Rpc itself should just report what is what. This also simplifies coding for now :-P.
