CAQ: Computer Action Queue

basically i was just generalizing what Music Timeline has become. I like how the acronym is pronounced lmfao. but yea i also thought about how complicated it's going to be (need to design it well) to do a series of songs on the timeline and then a shutdown. the action needs to be able to shut down the application (as well as the entire machine). it then needs to pick up at the very next action item on next start, including putting all the gui shit back how it was. basically the equivalent of modern desktops: i want windows positions (which will probably be plugins and/or in a QMdiArea thingy) and shit even unsaved states (text typed in before pressing "save", "commit", "publish", or anything really: it should know you're still working on it and repopulate the text edit for you or something). basically we want the gui to look exactly as it did when the shutdown action was processed. yes i know i'm getting OT, fuck it. ok and the equivalent of a "start" menu (shit that is only open momentarily), we do NOT have to remember and re-open (would be weird if windows tried doing that ya know?). obviously what my app considers "windows" and "start menus" (add action menu? idfk) will need to be defined
