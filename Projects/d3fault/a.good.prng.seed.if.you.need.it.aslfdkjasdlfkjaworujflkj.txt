my randomness
the grand total hash of all my data
say, some 4096+ length hash
is used as the predetermined-yet-LENGTHY-'random'-aka-pseudorandom(re-generable/re-traceable) seed
i tattoo that grand total hash on my arm
i take pictures of it multiple times and put them on the network. multiple angles multiple distances
i refer to them to compare to my own arm
if they look photoshopped i know i'm hacked
they can change my arm and they can change my pictures (but they cannot change my brain/memory (actually they probably could :-/))
but changing both my arm and the pictures without me noticing would be incredibly hard
and to make it so nobody notices that i'm gone/kidnapped (required for brain/memory erasing)
AND that my friends/peers irl nubs surrounding me don't also notice the changing of that hash

what the FUCK does having a consistent random (guaranteed random imo) number stream give me?
rofl
nothing.
