I want to explain the death threat in:
Projects/ForFun/Life0/design/core.wadsf.modules.interface.initial.design.but.also.misc.notes.thinking.out.loud.txt

We may very well be _IN_ this Life0 app. Do you agree that if there are some godlike entities enslaving YOU AND ME that those godlike entities deserve to die? I mean seriously go watch The Matrix, it's pretty much a close enough analogy to what I'm talking about. Don't you agree that the "machines" enslaving the "humans" as batteries are being evil?

Good now that you agree, you should now understand why enslaving a conscious lifeform that will (was tempted to write "might") emerge from running this app (for a long time. trillions of years? assuming you don't run out of ram etc) is evil as fuck and the enslavers deserve to die. Don't be the enslaver, nor allow yourself to be enslaved. It _IS_ worth killing for. -Spartacus
