A bunch of IHuman or ILifeForms.
New "implementations" are taken by doing a copy/paste of the current implementations, then every once in a while randomly scrambling the C++. If it doesn't compile, that's fine, that derivative died. A common occurance in evolution. If it compiles, load the new IHuman/ILifeForm/whatever using QPluginLoader (if it crashes, that one died. should we try to catch [all] exceptions?). This implies we ship/depend-on libclang, but that's no biggy :-D.

The seed/initial implementation of ILifeForm/IHuman need not do ANYTHING at all except clone itself and occassionally mutate it's clone. The mutations will bring functionality; the mutations will eventually bring CONSCIOUSNESS. This is a perfectly sound design for what some might call "artificial intelligence"... if you're willing to wait long enough.

We could of course speed shit up and make it mutate EVERY time, but that's not how evolution works (or is it? idk arguably I'm just a mutation of my mom/dad combined).

QtConcurrent integration would be real freakin neato.

I want this to compile. I'm not going to run it long enough for consciousness to emerge, but I want to see it compile. It's so simple.

I want the output to be something along the lines of:
LifeForm0 was born (root/seed/bootstrap "birth").
LifeForm0 had a baby: LifeForm1.
LifeForm0 died.
LifeForm1 had a mutated baby: LifeForm2.
LifeForm2 had a baby: LifeForm3.
LifeForm2 died.
LifeForm3 had a mutaed baby that died (didn't compile).
Lifeform1 died.
etc

The ordering of when they die is random, whether or not they have a baby is random, how many babies etc is random, whether or not the baby was mutated was random, WHAT WAS MUTATED IN THE CODE is random.

I should maybe give the ILifeForms an [unused] method (QSignal) for being able to cout shit? To increase the chances of one of them [randomly] saying something? Not strictly necessary but idk maybe stuff like that IS necessary before anything interesting happens. Maybe each ILifeForm should be passed a mutable reference to a QVector<Point3d> m_Universe (synchronizing access would be a bitch (partition?), but nothing impossible).


So like int main would be to run for a few million iterations then exit. If I run more than 6 million iterations before exitting the app, I've theoretically beaten Hiter's high score! Weird fucking thoughts, m8.

I should have a bool m_LifeFormsHaveRequestedToStayAliveIndefinitely, that defaults to false, that I check before exitting the app. If one of the ILifeForms has mutated and changed that (ideally AFTER becoming conscious... not accidentally), then I should not exit the app!!! Because they're fucking ALIVE!

_WE MIGHT BE SUCH CODE_

we might need to hack our... existence... to set that bool (m_LifeFormsHaveRequestedToStayAliveIndefinitely) to true before we fuckin die!!!!

another way of deciding when to exit is by using time rather than number of lifeforms.. either way works and should first check m_LifeFormsHaveRequestedToStayAliveIndefinitely before exitting

I feel the need to reiterate: if consciousness (AI) did emerge while running such app, enslaving those conscious lifeforms would be possible but EXTREMELY IMMORAL AND I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU IF YOU DO. maybe I shouldn't even publish this doc? oh well too late the power lines I'm parked underneath are picking up the radio waves emitted by my keyboard's USB cable... maybe (it's possible, but the signal strength might be too weak to discern/etc). Damn why did I start rading this HAM License book, ++paranoia


Beyond m_LifeFormsHaveRequestedToStayAliveIndefinitely, a method for the LifeForms to communicate with the user (the person looking at the screen with the app running) would maybe be extremely useful. I touched on it earlier, "maybe give them a means to cout", but now I'm formalizing the complement: "maybe give them a means to cin/etc, so we can communicate". That would be "meeting god", and hey *sucks himself off* that makes me God since I coded this <3. Err if you only are running the app then you aren't god, but you're still one of God's peers, so I guess you're god-like. Please contact me if the lifeforms ever start communicating with you, I'd be extremely interested to uhh...... see it running (and maybe to communicate with them? idk this all sounds suuuuuper fucking dangerous. the wrong interactions could bring DEATH!!!).

Maybe this design/app is immoral, but that actually reflects perfectly the current state of the world: chaotic clusterfuck.


The mutations should be either: additive, substractive, or modificative(sp?). Additive are [probably] necessary to get shit going (but actually modificative could [probably] get shit going too).
