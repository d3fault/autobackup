This is an abstract version of autobackup/Solutions/d3faultPublicLicense/tools/D3faultPublicLicenseCopyrightHeaderBulkPrepender that allows more specification (D3faultPublicLicenseCopyrightHeaderBulkPrepender is hardcoded as fuck)
Created to insert autobackup/Solutions/d3faultPublicLicense/header.prepend.dpl.v3.d3fault.launch.distribution.txt , in various formats, in the beginning of files of certain types:

c/cxx/cpp/cs/java = c style comments
pro/asm/s = hash comments
php/phps = <?php /* comments */ ?>
txt = no comments

The application also has a compile time hack to insert the text after the first line to account for the following types:
svg = xml comments
sh = hash comments


And I'm making note that I used it to put my temporary "All Rights Reserved" crap in header files:
h/hpp = proprietary + c style comments
