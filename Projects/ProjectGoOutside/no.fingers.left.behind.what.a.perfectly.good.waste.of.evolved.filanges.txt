No Finger Left Behind!

with a picture of my hand on my mouse with my right ring finger and right pinky floating/doing nothing. hell, even my left thumb barely does anything except grips the mouse...


while i want custom input interfaces, of course... aOS

i also want to be backwards compatible with a keyboard/mouse (special drivers i guess?)

i like the idea of using two fingers to control the mouse, and another two to do clicking
and then all of them together (maybe a change-mode gesture in between... representing you moving your hand from the mouse to the keyboard (gaming requires both simultaneously)) for the keyboard
