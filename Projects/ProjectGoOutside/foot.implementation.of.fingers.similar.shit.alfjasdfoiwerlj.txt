i was laying on my bed listening to music and beating my feet to the music
i've thought of this before, but never finalized how it'd be done
now i got it

my range is merely further when laying down, but i can be sitting and tapping my foot (either ball of foot or heal, both work)

anyways, onto implementation:

black band velcro shit wrapped around each shin with hook/loop on front


same type of potentiometer (linear slider) as with fingers, but longer because my foot has more range than my fingers
only the top half of the potentiometer is attached to the hook
the bottom half sways or whatever sort of
the slider itself (the thing that moves) has a spring going back to the black strap (just like fingers) and a regular string extending outward toward my toe, which it ties around

that's pretty much it
i beat my feet, and the string is pulled
there might need to be a stabilization thing (???????????) on the bottom of the potentiometer, but i am unsure about this


holy fucking shit man stop fucking around with ABC/RPC and god damnit fucking launch already

it's worth it just so you can use this shit for music making
seriously, everything else aside, i just want to make music :(

coding while mobile is a huge bonus too. fuck this chair.
