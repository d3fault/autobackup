i should settle for a non-dht version of an app store/download-site (sameshit) to host my aOS/visual/physical applications made using designEquals...
it's a more realistic target and fuck it i can just put up this bullshit ad agency shit on it and make plenty of profits. i will be 'rich enough'... but lots of businessmen would shake their heads at all the opportunities i'm intentionally not giving a fuck about.
