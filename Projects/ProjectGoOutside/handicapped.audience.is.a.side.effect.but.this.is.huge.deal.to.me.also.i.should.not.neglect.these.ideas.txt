i never thought of this till just now...
aOS, while being power conserving and freeing my eyes to allow me to focus on walking/hiking/etc/LIFE/LIVING...
...also would HUGELY appeal to the blind community
sup blind fucks.

visual would appeal to regular users as well as deaf users (there is hardly a difference here, aside from sound fx obviously)
and PHYSICAL feedback (vibrations scattered around mah body... just because feelsgoodman) would appeal to the deaf/blind community... hello <whats-her-name-again?>

integrating the 3 would be key
designing an app in d3fault (design=implementation) should transparently make the app accessable by all 3 "views" (views is a horrible description)
i need to mentally disect "what makes an app"
how to iterate between "basic menu items" or "basic gui items"... somewhat similar to tab indexes for inputs... but also to read outputs etc as well
the visual markup would be specific, every app has a default view that doesn't have custom gui code that goes along with how the aOS sees it... and SOMEHOW(???) how the visual feedback is felt.

reading back text via audio/visual is piece of cake
the physical feedback is different
i only imagined the vibrations being 1 for each letter of the alphabet.. i guess it could do that while reading back too... only REALLY fast (as fast as their body can sense)... whereas on input it just confirms your keys pressed
somewhat similar to braille, the body is trained to react to physical stimulation which triggers reading

man this is good shit, anything that targets accessability like this is ALWAYS big
i should definitely keep this in mind when i design some shit...
it's cool that it's all just a side effect of me pleasing myself <3
a person does best when acting for themself
lining yourself up to also benefit others as a result is rare and awesome
