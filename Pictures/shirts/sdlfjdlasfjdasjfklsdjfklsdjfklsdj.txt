eh these aren't shirts but are instead signs.
0) I was walkin around beaumont and saw a lot of "beware of dog" signs, some of em had a silhouette (sp wtf) of a dog barking. "beware of god" would be better, with a silhouette of jeebus sitting down on the ground leaning back against a building holding out a cup (asking for spare change ofc, but those words aren't on the sign). oh and he'd have a halo too
1) all over riverside county are signs with arrows pointing at the streets "the bus stops here". meh "the buck stops here". ok ok it's not that funny (but putting those stickers (just the word "buck" over "bus") would be a fun prank)
