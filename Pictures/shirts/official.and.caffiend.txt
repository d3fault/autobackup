0) Official
It's kinda like those "SECURITY" shirts they sell, but is more about looking like a..... politician(???) than a cop/security-guard. Just the word "official" makes me giggle: you are official if you say you are, that's the definition of official! I'm reminded of an old doc I wrote saying (paraphrasing now) that organized crime only has one difference from government: government writes down on a piece of paper that it is official.
