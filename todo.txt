deploy:
hottee -- create folder if not exist
ffmpeg segment uploader (4 mins alert)

do:
git auto submodulization (solves binaries problem)
page jump = segfault
dirs sorted?
Hottee: "working dir(s)", on start create hotteeAt<timestamp> sub-folder (fail if it exists (UNLESS RESUMING, in which case we need to know that hotteeAt<timestamp> sub-folder as an arg))
Hottee: "q" -> we will quit when the input process closes, if the upload queue is [still] empty a few seconds after the input process closes
