async_if (or Q_ASYNC_IF). even though the below sounds more fun, this sounds more likely to change my coding style forver. It _IS_ the idea from d=i solidified into pure C++ code (no gui needed)

MAYBE THE FOLLOWING RE-LAUNCH PLAN IS TOO MUCH? MAYBE I SHOULD JUST ANALOG/QUICKDIRTY(had:LAZY)-MODE IT AND THEN IMPROVE ON IT LIVE?!?
re-launch (this is ordered by dependency!):
0) StupidKeyValueContentTracker should be coded, and then WHEN NEEDED by that app (when I hit compile and my pseudo code fails), TimeAndData_Timeline should be put into place, since it's trivial as FUCK
1) SocialNetworkTimeline (A lib/QLocalServer! no ui YET!) should be coded, using StupidKeyValueContentTracker. see StupidKeyValueContentTracker/design/sdflksdjfklsdjflkdjsfkljsdfoiuewrlkjsdofusldkfjdsifukl.txt
2) D3faultNetLiveVideoFeed, which uses SocialNetworkTimeline as an "output" and [transparent] backup solution

^^I think I want to code/finish-to-usable-1.0-state SocialNetworkTimeline but then upload all my files (everything from binary to text!) before re-launching the "live video" stream. Why? idk, impulse I guess. Desire, that's why. Why do I want to? Because I want to. I'm a human bean and don't have to justify my actions [as long as they aren't harmful]. Still that's a slippery slope, I certainly don't want to imply that people should go about in this world without first thinking about the actions you're about to perform! Think of an action you want to do, make sure it's not harmful, then do it if you [still] want to (you might have lost interest in it by now, who knows).
^I admit there's a part of me that doesn't want to re-launch the live stream (but it's too late to turn back <3)

UNORDERED DEP OF ABOVE RE-LAUNCH: wasdf. I'd be happy if it was NOT integrated with any of the above timeline shiz and we only "recorded" the raw video/audio and didn't [YET] properly serialize the wasdf shit to timeline. I only need the "VanillaLeftHand_RightIndexFingerIsPitchRocker" WasdfModule to be functional, and I think I'm actually pretty close to that because I did some research when I had the nets and I think I found solution to pitch rocker problem: use effects not Voicer).

I should TEST "re-launch" 10 fucking times: be playing ddrace, exit after 3 mins, click stand up, STAND UP button, then Ctrl+Alt+Del to activate "decay" xscreensaver (which would look AMAZING after just changing video feed sources to my head-cam), THEN GO FOR A MULTI DAY HIKE (or go snowboarding somewhere with a season pass?). but obv don't need to go on 10 multi day hikes lol xD (however should stress test video shit for many hours)...


wasdf
d=i -> make osios using d=i -> make d=i using d=i as a tab in osios (and everything that implies, such as timelinized(serlialized in timeline fashion) actions)
