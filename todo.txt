deploy:
hottee
ffmpeg segment uploader

do:
hvbs 24hr + cookie
abc explain vids
music fingers vanilla piano (DOIT FAGGOT)
"not serving this"
binarySupplement post-update also?
copyleft disclaimer (assignment is easiest, but shitty)
git auto submodulization (solves binaries problem)
Hottee: "working dir(s)", on start first check currentDateTime >= 2015, then create hotteeAt<timestampWithMs> sub-folder (fail if it exists (UNLESS RESUMING, in which case we need to know that hotteeAt<timestamp> sub-folder as an arg))
~24hr cronjob: make torrent of all 'yesterdays' (just ended day) video segments -- also same for weekly (later, bump that to monthly) -- hvbs download page builds links based on torrents it finds in a directory?
num unique visitors (wt unique id?) per day
