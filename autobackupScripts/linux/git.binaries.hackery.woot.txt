EDIT/IMPORTANT: if you do a git "shallow" clone, as this doc describes later on, you should name the folder that it's in accordingly. For example, "shallowBinarySupplement" vs. "binarySupplement". I did not encounter, but I got like 5% close to encountering (<3 redundancy), a case where i deleted a copy of a full git repo because I planned on cloning to recreate it (I ran out of room in a truecrypt volume, so I deleted it, created a bigger one, then tried to clone and facepalm.jpg'd when I was trying to clone from a shallow repo -- and then I realized that it COULD HAVE BEEN a serious problem)

Binaries in git suck by default, but if you modify .gitattributes (have a binary-only repo, or add binary extensions to .gitattributes (i prefer a catch all approach (echo "* -delta -diff -text" > .gitattributes) and two separate repos)) to never do delta compression in addition to the following, you can use git AS FAST AS 'regular copying' while still having versioning and simple (well, complicated but scriptable!) "git push"-ing to initiate the backups. For my own needs right now I want the following:

1x "file view" (no .git dir, BUT STILL USING GIT :-P)
2x "bare repos" (they are both BASICALLY bare, but one of them is secretly associated with the file view above ;-P)

/files, /backup1, backup2 <-- for simplicity (and backup1 will be our secretly associated "bare" repo)

----CREATING FIRST TIME ONLY
cd into /files and do:
git --work-tree=/files --git-dir=/backup1 init


----MADE CHANGES, TIME TO COMMIT
cd into /files and do:
git --work-tree=/files --git-dir=/backup1 add -v .
git --work-tree=/files --git-dir=/backup1 commit -am "Commit Message"


----THE 'N' NUMBER OF BACKUPS (creating, sync'ing)
to make a new backup:
git clone --bare file:///backup1 /backup2
to synchronize the backups, cd into /backup1 and do:
git push /backup2


----RESTORING FROM BACKUP LATER
backup1, backup2, etc all still exist, but you lose your /files folder from doing an OS-reinstall or whatever (hdd crash?):
mkdir /files
git archive --remote=file:///backup1 master | tar -x -C /files

^then of course you use it just like the "MADE CHANGES, TIME TO COMMIT" section



You can even have "/files" be some random external flash drive, and this design only copies from it ONCE (directly into git 'bare'(ish)!). Deleting the files on the external flash drive would make them hidden in your git history though (but still retrievable :-P)


woot this is even better than "git clone --depth=1" <3


probably the best part imo is that you get to just type "git fsck" and it verifies everything for you...
