To enable networking on VirtualBox to/from host/guest and to/from guest/guest etc,
1) With all guests shut down go to File->Preferences->Network, keep clicking "Add Host" button for each guest vm. Leave its settings as default
2) Go to specific guest vm settings -> Network -> Adapter 2, change "Attached To" to "Host-only Adapter" and then select respective vboxnetX cards. Leave its settings as default
3) Launch the OS and assuming it's debian-based, edit /etc/network/interfaces. Add below "eth0" entry (or just end of file):

auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
	address 192.168.56.10
	netmask 255.255.255.0


Additional guests (vboxnet1, etc) would use 192.168.57.10, then 58.10, etc. I have no idea why in the vm settings for vbox0 it shows IP 56.1 and not 56.10, but eh fuck it works don't fix it.



then of course:

ifup eth1


...or just reboot
