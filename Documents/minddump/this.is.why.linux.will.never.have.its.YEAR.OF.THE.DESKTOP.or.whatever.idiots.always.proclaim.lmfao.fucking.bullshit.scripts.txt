I hate scripts.

so on Fedora, #!/bin/sh at the top works fine with a read -n command
debian, it errors our (NOT STOPPING!!!!) saying unsupported -_-

so I decided yesterday I'll just put #!/bin/bash at the top, maybe it's the safer more supported way?

but while running my cleanAptEtc.sh script with #!/bin/bash at the top, my:
echo "\n"
line actually echos the string: \n
ROFL.
/bin/sh outputs a newline as it should

... but yea you get the fucking idea ...


I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH

-differing functionality accross platforms (probably due to ln -s usage if i had to guess)
-the removal of certain features of certain commands (read -n)

= enough

Fuck that shit, I'm going to script in Qt/C++.

Hell, maybe I could/can/should make a Qt interpretter (THAT DOES NOT VARY IN FUNCTIONALITY ACCROSS _ANY_ PLATFORM, windows included :-P)

#!/bin/qtzcript

'Z' so as not to be confused with the actual class: QtScript :-/
...or maybe the actual class QtScript can help? but I think that's more for scripting inside of an application (maybe that's what i want tbh, idfk atm), idfk. never used it or even looked at it
