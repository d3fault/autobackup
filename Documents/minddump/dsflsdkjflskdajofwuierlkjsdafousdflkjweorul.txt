I'm getting so anxious
I'm also second guessing everything
I'm frightened
Scared shitless

Such is life, we all must die.

Exhilerating

I NEED TO START LIVING
I HATE CURRENT LIFE


muuuuuuuuuuusic is what i anticipate most lately
just RANDOM FUCKING LOUD NOISES
WHO GIVES A SHIT HOW GOOD IT SOUNDS
I WANT TO _LIVE_ IN IT
