Fuck "normalcy/robotic-communisim/mathematically-enforced-equality". It's easy to design a resource harvesting system of robots and even living quarters where people don't have to interact with each other NECESSARILY. It's much more difficult to design a government that is invulnverable to sociopathy (and those normalcy concepts still need some form of government). It's even more difficult than that, to migrate to a government invulnerable to sociopathy, from a government vulnerable to and exploited (run) by sociopaths. Democracy is an order of magnitude better than monarchy/etc, but it's still a piece of shit because of it's vulnerability to sociopathy.

Hell you can even take government out of the equation (KISS) and it's still a bitch of a problem to solve: sociopathy is the root of the problem. Until we can solve sociopathy, we can't design a better government. I'm open to suggestions, but I don't even think having every human attached to lie detectors 24/7/365 would solve it.
