the good news is that you can never be self aware therefore know what is coming (death) when you are anything lower than a human
nobody is born a dog and says "aww fuck i wish i was a human"
other animals are self aware, but not anywhere near the extent we are. they are only self aware in that they can recognize themselves in the mirror
