5 years ago I envied Kevin Rose and wanted to work at Digg
2 years ago (?) I envied Thiago Macieira and wanted to work at Nokia

funny how things change~
Now I lol at Digg (isn't technologically complex (and fuck php)) and think Thiago is an absent minded professor (brilliant low level engineer), and also don't want to work at ANY corporation because then I have lost creative freedom

inb4 "thiago doesn't work at nokia"
