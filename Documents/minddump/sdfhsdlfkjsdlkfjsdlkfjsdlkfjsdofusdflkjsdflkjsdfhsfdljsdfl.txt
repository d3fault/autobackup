My dad's such a fucking yoyo. He yells or bangs something, it scares the dog/cat, they come into my room (I have to open door for them usuually). Some time passes, he does it again... this time the dog gets curious (cat usually stays) and wants out. Repeat 20x per day and that's your average day in this house. 20 interruptions while _CODING_ makes me want to fucking kill everybody on the face of the planet (starting with you know who).
