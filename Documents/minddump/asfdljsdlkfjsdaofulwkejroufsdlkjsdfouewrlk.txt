A "revolution release" is a release which is proprietary/copyrighted that is viewed and shown by me (since I broadcast all actions) without my knowing that the content was indistributable. It will probably occur more than rarely, though I will not seek them out. It is named as such because it felt like I'd be a leader of a revolution when I first thought of it. Now it just seems like an infrequent emergence. The FBI warnings and copyright notices would need to be stripped from the beginning of the film in order for me to continue watching it.

I need to discontinue watching a work as soon as I see an FBI warning, "unlawful distribution" warning. HOWEVER there is a wonky hack (that might not even work) around it: pre-pend all my works with the same FBI warning! Since it only specifies "unlawful distribution", Copyleft has the existence of unlawful distributions as well so it IS relevant. Then, FBI warnings of "unlawful distribution" become ambiguious and I'd need to depend on something more explicit such as "Copying" etc not being allowed. I also need to double check that FBI warning as I don't even remember what it says ENTIRELY. It might mention "copying" itself. _STILL_, that I can use an FBI warning with Copyleft'd releases is a pretty neat little discovery: the government backs my use of Copyright (through Copyleft). Or perhaps that should read "use of Copyleft (through Copyright)", idfk.
