I'm in the middle of reading the chapter "On restraining your will" in Montaigne's: The Complete Essays (I skipped to that chapter as it sounded... relevant), and well, aside from he and Socrates (or was it Plato? fuck it) both mentioning the whole "we must live in a balance between a hate of pain and a love of pleasure" coinciding with my very thoughts (I AM HUMAN!), Montaigne mentions a blurb that catches my attention and summarizes the Free Software (freedom of information) movement in it's entirety: "I have been able to engage in public duties without going even a nail's breadth from myself, and to give myself to others without taking myself away from me". Fucking brilliant.
