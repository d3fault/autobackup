the only security i believe in:
a) certs for authenticity/verification (maybe encryption too)
b) distribution (hardcopies esp)


so if i just "save" by PUBLISHING EVERYWHERE

....  i can live comfortably

knowing the data is safe

and that's all that matters


i guess i can still do my 'prediction' shit using certs


but i still need to re-organize d3fault to NOT use passwords

which i have yet to do
