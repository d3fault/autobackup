i wanted to write "previous" err no. i wanted to write "more fulfilling" but i can't remember what it was about. the second one. of which? i have no idea. but there was a first. i just can't remember it. i am trying oh so very hard to dump the contents of my mind because i feel as though it will atain bliss but i am not sure if i should go backwards to corrects typos like that lack of t and as *s. fml i waste so much time on tangents that i can never maintain the main point even though i know wich with* tangents i can pick up where i was left off. especially with *indefinite* time which I do actually and logically believe I will have.
