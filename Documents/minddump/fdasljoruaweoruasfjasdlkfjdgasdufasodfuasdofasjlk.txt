i am not having fun coding lately
i am procrastinating
timestamps show it
but meh
buffers, audio bytes, synchronization, timestamps... shit's killing me
tangent after tangent after tangent
just to make a buck
i hope this is all worth it

i want coding to go back to being fun!!!
fffff
a little bit of pain and i might be RETIRED
guh
money sucks

so i told hannah yesterday that i'm going to "make and sell a video library to other developers"
it's a good cover
good as in i might be able to survive off that in the long run
or just sell it as a whole dgaf

i have a video library company/page
it utilizes an auto-update-dll http/html api 'spec' that i (the company) invents and utilizes on the site (remember to do the sample app that utilizes the dlls, it's kinda necessary as something to point to)

libMegaParser
and
libIceParser (maybe with a level of cache called 'icecache'. still unsure if user will parse icefilms or if i will (via proxies once i get b&)
USE THE SAME update api?
