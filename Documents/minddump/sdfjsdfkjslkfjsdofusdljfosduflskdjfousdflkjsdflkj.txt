Micro: gotta look at where you toes touch the ground to see where you are and what you should do in this instance. We have infinite 'tries' macro, but only one micro. Have to analyze both scenarios and then do your best to make them join at some point. Micro is responding to your environment and what you can do and what can be done in general on your planet and in your era. Macro is forgetting your planet and era exist, and your body too... and being a rubber band ball of electricity (conscience) floating in a void and wondering what to do (code(logic-puzzles),music(art)). It's a weird and true contradiction. Do I or don't I have infinite tries? Both is the answer. Bleh.
