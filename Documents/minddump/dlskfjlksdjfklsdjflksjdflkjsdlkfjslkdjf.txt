-Non-emergency line
-Micro v. Macro: Not holding gun to my head this very moment, but trying to figure out what to do with my life and an extreme depression is making me want to kill myself. Deep down I know I want to live, which is why I'm making this phone call.
-I know why I'm depressed: In this economy(society?) you have to dominate or be dominated. Manipulate or be manipulated. I want to be a good person, so if I dominate/manipulate then I would feel like a bad person and depressed out of guilt. But if I'm dominated/manipulated, I'd get angry and depressed. Both options lead to depression.
-"There are some things worse than death": i think a life of depression is one of them

-As long as I don't have to manipulate or be manipulated, I'm a perfectly happy and sane human being.

-What is your solution to the problem? I have one but it's far-fetched (so I want to hear your attempt first)



-Only use if needed: There's no way you can convince me that manipulating others isn't bad. I could write a computer program to manage humans.
