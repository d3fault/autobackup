In my previous commit message I said "If I'm not able to exist given current law". A crucial element of that that I omitted is that the/my existence is completely non-evil. If a non-evil existence is illegal, the law must change. ("If the glove does not fit...")

Perhaps I should even factor in the whole brainwash aspect to complete the argument:
If a sane non-evil existence is illegal, the law must change.
