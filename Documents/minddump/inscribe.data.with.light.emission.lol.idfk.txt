oh yea also jelly of your faster-than-light transportation but ya know... priorities right?


dude that means light from every historical event has been emitted into the universe. it is just a matter of putting a right microsoft (rofl, *microsof- microscope) MICROSOCOPE a specific distance away from the earth using faster than light transportation and then capturing the light emitted. if they stay at that point, they capture time perspectives occurring in the past

so really, all you have to do to see the past is go faster than the speed of light away from a clear unobstructed view of the event you want to capture
and when you go there, you make your recording of events that happened in the past... perhaps before you were born (watching ww2 unfold would be amazing). as you travel back, time speeds up until you get back to that place you left from and it will guaranteed take you back to sometime after you left. how much time is debatable. i think it would be normal time elapsing.
