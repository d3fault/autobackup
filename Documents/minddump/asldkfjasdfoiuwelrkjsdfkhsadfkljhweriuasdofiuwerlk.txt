i'm only sure of one thing:
love SEEMS real

i am not sure i am here (prove you exist etc)
but i know that i am pretty sure i am here
and given the above statement, what SEEMS real, is.
so love is real given i ASSUME i am here (which i do)


so...
love SEEMS real
is pretty much the same as (as far as i'm concerned)
love IS real
