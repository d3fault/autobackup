you can see a large part (lol wrote sea at first) of me wants to throw it all out there
live free
etc

but i am still scurred of the ramifications
WHAT IS THE WORST THAT HAPPENS?
early death.
WHAT IS THE BEST THAT HAPPENS?
live infinitely.


holy shit
that really is what it boils down to

yes there is PLENTY of middle ground... and middle ground is the most likely

but for that miniscule hope of living infinitely (coding infinitely)...
... i guess i should throw my nuts onto the wall
isn't that the waying? s

24+ will be hard if i have digitized the fuck out of it (integrated it with teh softwarez, recording backspaces etc <-TODOreq book backups could somehow show backspace'd shit)

but i mean on-site ads (and abc itself) would sustain me

the buuks are just backups

and my throwing myself out there..... harder? (edit: as in... further. not more difficult)

like media (steven colebereted (lol hi you referencing this on the show)) would have me on and stuff?

hmmm..... doubling my backups from 2 copies on 1tb drives to over a hundred copies (i'd LOL if i didn't make that many) practically instantly.... YES PLEASE

now all that remains is me not being a bitch.
wish me luck future readers.
