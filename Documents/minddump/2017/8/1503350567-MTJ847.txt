re: "I'm a lover not a killer"

Who the fuck says the two are mutually exclusive? I argue that if you are an intelligent/strong lover that you sometimes also must be a killer: to DEFEND that love.

If you aren't willing to kill for your love, you're either stupid, a wimp, or it isn't love in the first place.

Love _IS_ worth killing for, I've finally come to terms with that. I am willing to kill for love. Absofuckinglutely and I feel completely moral in saying it.
