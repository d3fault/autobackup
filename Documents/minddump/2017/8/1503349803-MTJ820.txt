Comedy pushes the limits of what is socially acceptable (censored or not) so much so that it _defines_ where that line is. Comedians are intelligent people who verbally dance in the grey area of "just barely not censored", and their dancing there pushes the line further from [the group of] them, like two magnets of the same polarity pushi- NAH NVM fuck that analogy doesn't fit.


Comedy also makes it easier to swallow ugly truths.


I saw Bill Motherfucking Murray a little ago and am now considering introducing comedy into my plans.


My previous thoughts on comedy were "what I'm doing is too serious (had:funny) to incorporate comedy" but now I am wondering if maybe the following is true: "what I'm doing is too serious to NOT incorporate comedy". If comedy really does help with swallowing ugly truths, then that might be the case. The ugly truth I speak of is: our species mostly consists of good people delusionally doing harm to the species overall (the delusion is that they are doing good).
