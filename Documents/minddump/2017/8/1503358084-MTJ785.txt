I did a little bit of research on the Unabomber a couple weeks back, because I was curious of his reasoning for killing people... and because a lot of people have compared me to him over the years. I read the wikipedia article and a tiny bit of his manifesto (tl;dr). While I, like many, agree with a lot of his introduction arguments, I found a flaw in his logic. I also want to compare and contrast myself with him a little bit.

The flaw in logic: he says technology is bad, then goes out to live in a cabin and teaches himself survival skills using..... TECHNOLOGY. Primitive technology, but technology nonetheless. OT'ish it's kinda like a revolutionary killing their corrupt government only to start up a government that then becomes corrupt (because they as of 2017, they all do (please for the love of god prove me wrong)).

also for lulz I tried reading some of his manifesto replacing instances of the word "technology" with "women" -- because women are in general manipulative as fuck (just like "technology" is, according to Unabomber)... but of course I wouldn't be saying this if I were getting any ;-).

It's so strange how similar our thought process is though... it's almost as if we are both *gasp* human and both *gasp* live on this same shitty planet (in this same shitty era I should say; I have high hopes for the future)! Like we're both FOR the destruction of industry, wew!

His approach: mail bombs to people involved with technology
My approach: use defensive publication of patent-worthy ideas, and actively create libre software, to cause tons of would-be businesses (who depend on patented ideas), to never exist
^I really think the hacker community is metric fucking shit tons smarter than the business minded shitfucks. We can and do out-do them. See: Linux

I acknowledge maybe he's right and I'm wrong. Maybe I'm a pussy.
