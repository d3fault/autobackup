It gets complicated when I say I love my species, considering the completely fucked state of the planet's social infrastructure.

The problem is classifying who gets killed. I simply cannot define the class of people who need to die to improve the situation. Since (and only since) that is the case, killing isn't the answer.


I would kill a person to solve world hunger (but I'd surely try many other measures first).
