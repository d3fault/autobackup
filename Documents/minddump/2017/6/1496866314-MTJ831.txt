hmm actually I think that somewhere in a core document it already says that (about human rights yada);
the problem is that individuals elect people to enforce their preferences, those elected force judges (in court) to enforce those preferences, and such is life.


there is no law but that which the currently alive generation prefers to be law.
what I mean is, there are a lot of stale laws that will not (in practice (they do in theory (and still can if someone wants to target you))) affect you and that you "can" ignore. hell you are probably breaking tons of them that you haven't even heard of.


to write some beautifully worded protections of life and liberty for all........ is a complete fucking waste of time (even if it is put into law) because the individuals themselves make their own preferences law. as you might imagine, communities vary greatly on the preferences they use the law to (force? enforce? -- basically to control you while you are within their vicinity).


law can only be used to make illegal inherently evil things, not to make illegal the things that individuals don't prefer (or simply prefer less).

I'm pretty sure it doesn't say that in any core documents (but even if it did, it wouldn't matter.... ;-P).
