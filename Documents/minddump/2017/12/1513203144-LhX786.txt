The reason love hurts so bad (physically. that gut wrenching vomit inducing feeling of heartbreak) is because you made a bad investment with something extremely valuable to you: your love. You gave your partner your love with the hope that they'd return the love. When you find out that you've been giving love and not receiving it, you realize you've wasted your/the MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE: love. love is what life is all about, so if you find out you've been loving someone who hasn't been loving you back, there's a big chunk of your life that's now meaningless (or less meaningful). you probably FELT their heartbreak long before you were able to confirm it: we pick up on such subtle social cues to deduce, even subconsciously, what another person is REALLY saying/thinking.

We put so much effort into various aspects of our lives: education, health, professional careers, etc. but those are all arguably in the name of love in the first place!

We might as well say that "love is the positive emotional energy emitted from humans". and conveniently not mention our negative side ;-P.
