I am a bear. I roam, I eat, I sleep.

context: bears sleep just like we do, but on longer timescales. just as it's possible to explore an area of earth during the winter and erroneously conclude that bears don't live there, so too could aleenz visit earth during night and erroneously conclude that an "intelligent" species isn't present.
