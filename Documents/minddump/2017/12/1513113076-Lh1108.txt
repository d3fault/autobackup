I want to find a girl who wants nothing from me but an emotional connection. I'll let you know if/when I find her. *dies*


nah she's out there but I ain't throwin up the right (or any) flags/signs yet (think American History X, but instead of prison and swastika tattoo it's the internet and my sexy face pic). I'm not expressing myself fully/correctly. Arguably at all. I'm not expressing myself so much so that the amount I express "approaches zero" in calculus terms. Relative to how much I want/need to be expressing myself. Why don't I have a fucking video camera on my head right now? I hate my life.
