our Wetware OS (consciousness) can't "read" without also "writing". we make note of the fact that we remembered(recalled) a memory from the past.

"a self aware wetware OS" is more descriptive than "alive"

a self aware and extremely emotional wetware OS

a self aware and extremely emotional and psychologically fragile wetware OS

oh, the horror.
oh, the neat, as well.

5 miles away is a different universe.
