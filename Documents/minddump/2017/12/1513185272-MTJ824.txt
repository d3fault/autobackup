Bleh killing "old money" is not the solution. If you were born into money and you'd been raised by your family's bank's financial advisors to only do actions which are financially advisable, would that make you "evil"? No. These are eccentric chodes; the movie "The Ruling Class" gives a comical-yet-accurate depiction of these 1%ers. They just walk on clouds and don't really do... ANYTHING. At some point you get so rich that all you have to do is pay financial advisors and you become richer (yea there's chance of failure, but as long as you spread your eggs out over many baskets (financial advisors DO THIS FOR YOU!) the chances are pretty slim). The financial advisors themselves are just doing what they were taught in school and are more or less apathetic to the EFFECTS that various business investments have [on earth and humans as a whole]: they have pledged their financial advising allegience to that "family" of wealth. profit #1 goal or else fired.

So yea "old money" elects "old money" to protect "old money" from "new money", it really is quite stupid and simple and braindead. Their financial advisors basically do all the critical thinking for them: the polished plan of action is presented in front of them as they sit on their thrown. they nod in approval, then the plan is put into action. ex: "let's (a handful of 'old money' families) back 'Jimmy Politickin' for the mayoral election, that way we will get tax cuts hahahahaha". This isn't fiction, this isn't far fetched, this is probably happening tons. This is a problem for our species, though (it's not a problem for THEM (old money) of course ;-P. problems are relative/subjective!) not one resulting from "pure evil intent" -- more just like "ooo money *grabs*", like the kneejerk reaction of a baby, child, or animal.
