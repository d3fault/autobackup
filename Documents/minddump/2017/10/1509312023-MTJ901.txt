I don't like to trademark drop, but in this case I'm talking some good clean shit.
I liked Windows 95 as an operating system better than Android (any version). It was just stabler. It did less, and that was a good thing. These days I use Debian "Stable" Xfce, which one could argue has very similar GUI as Windows 95. That is intentional. Xfce is intended on being a MINIMAL desktop environment. Dear Desktop Environment(s): do what you NEED to do, then GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAY. That's why I like Xfce. Android is buggy as shit and always gets in my way trying to be "smart". I would install Windows 95 on my phone if I could........ but obviously the best solution is to add a SocialNetworkTimeline "phone" feature/plugin and then to deploy SocialNetworkTimeline on Android ;-P (assuming you can't first uninstall Android... which you usually CAN'T because Google (and other phone hw makers) are fucking sociopaths)...
