Good Mood: "The universe is my bitch right now"
Bad Mood: "I am the universe's bitch right now"
Felt like shit yesterday because I couldn't get my LibStk_LoopAudioFileAndModifyItsPitchUsingAsliderWidget port to QAudioOutput working (took me hours of trial-n-error before I put the casts to 'float' in there and it worked), but when I finally got i to work I said the above out loud "woohoo, the universe is my bitch right now... and not vica-versa".

Bad trips [on psychedellics] stem from you facing the fact that life is fucking terrifying. A lot of people, hell I'd argue most, go through their entire lives never facing that fact. "Sheer terror" (Sphere) is the correct response to life (and in that Sphere movie, the correct response to _alien_ life). There are just a lot of attrocious things going on around me. I watched BARAKA again recently (I think I confused it with Koyyinosqatzi a few years ago when writing some shit about how it's depressing as fuck), because I wanted to feel like shit. It worked perfectly. While watching it I thought "ok so there's the problem (the whole movie is about the problem), but what is the solution?"


I don't fantacize about being rich like most people do; I fantacize about hanging out with friends and family (collectively, "loved ones") and making music and just living in a cloud of love 24/7/365/indefinitely. I'm lucky to have grown up in a moderately wealthy family, because otherwise that probably wouldn't be the case: I'd probably fantacize about being rich like most people do. SPOILER: rich people pay through the nose for the things poor people get for cheap/nearly-free/sometimes-completely-free -- so if you rich and wanna stay rich, behave like a poor person (which ironically most likely defeats the purpose of you becoming rich in the first place: vanity/power-over-others/etc).
