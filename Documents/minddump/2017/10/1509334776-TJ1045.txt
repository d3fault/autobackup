Inhale however, but exhale marijuana through your nose. It feels weird at first, but I think it might be more efficient. Like the THCs can get through the blood-brain barrier easier in your nose area maybe? Yehh I ain't no chemist idfk. But in any case, I think the fact that exhaling out your nose would at least cover more "raw surface area" of your fucking insides, man, makes it more efficient. Checkmate chemists.
