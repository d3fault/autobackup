In Bakersfield I was chillin in my camper and saw a bug on my table. I used the nearest piece of trash I could find, an empty toilet paper tube, to scoop that fucker up. Opened door to camper (err from camper TO outside world) and tried to blow through the tube to set him free. Amazing story, isn't it? jk anyways well he had a strong as fuck grip and wouldn't budge so I just dropped the tube on the ground in front of camper door. Some time later it smelled like shit near my camper and I realized someone had seen me "litter" and fukken poop-bombed my front door as revenge. Also, my sandals were outside (filled with thorns) and very carefully rightside up (but on top of thorn heaven)... and I'm 99% sure I heard someone kick them over because when I came out I saw one of them flipped over. or maybe it was wind and I heard them throw the.... looked like a wad of paper towels, semi-neatly folded to hold the poop (but not the poop *smell*) in.

Good for them.
I realized that the only way to "stop" it from happening was to hunt them down (hard af) and reason with them to stop (also hard af, but probably easier than the former (had:format)). That being so hard to do I decided to just leave instead. Good for them.

btw I picked the tube up later (and this is around the time when I noticed the poop bomb and sandals)
