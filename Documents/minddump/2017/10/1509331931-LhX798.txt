As I go throughout the day I write down things on my whiteboard to help me remember what to write once my computer is on. It is not actually that bad of a strategy. I then write like 5 entries in bulk and they fit nicely together in a single commit and it's time effective and can be moved (or even interrupted if ABSOLUTELY necessary) to different times. So yea that's what I'm doing now is processing those. But I also write shit I come up with it right when I come up with it, if my computer is up and running. So the ordering of these is unfortunately potentially lost at least for within about 10 of each other or so but that's probably tops and this is a corner case anyways.
