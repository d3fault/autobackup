A hypothetical argument with a judge over the "littering is illegal" + "dumping is illegal" thing, if I were to be cited for dumping (because I sure as shit don't litter):

(assuming we already glossed over the whole "trash guys need to be paid for their services" argument)
Judge: you're supposed to drive to the county landfill every time you want to throw your trash away
Me: it costs the trashmen $0.0000001 extra to take my trash along with the rest of the dumpster's contents. costs ME like $20 in gas... plus my TIME. and what about the environment? My vehicle pollutes more by my driving to the landfill
J: environment not important; only profits of trashmen important
M: fuck you

and then they throw the book at me :)
which is why if it ever happens I would omit the "fuck you" part. but everything else is pretty much EXACTLY how it'd go down. the judge wouldn't "throw the book at me" for respectfully speaking my mind, but I'd still be found guilty and fined

when I originally spoke this doc out loud to myself in the camper, I also said to myself: "if you had balls, you'd say it"
balls AND foolishness?

it's both. it ("fuck you") kinda sorta needs to be said..... but at the same time judges have a lot of leeway to fuck with anyone who doesn't treat them like royalty. they have a TON of power and you better fucking fear that power. sad truth.


and now a semi-OT doc that I just re-remembered and that's been bouncing around in my head for some months now:
Law is like tar; don't get it on you or you'll be trapped for life. Your loved ones will see you struggling with it but they won't be able to help you. They'll just watch you struggle and get sucked down into the Lebrea Tar Pits. They WANT to help you, but they don't want to get sucked in along with you.
