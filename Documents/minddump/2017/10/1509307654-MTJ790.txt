Simplify your life. That way, you have the spare mental capacity required to focus on the IMPORTANT things requiring complex solutions.

Alternatively, the things requiring complex solutions needn't necessarily be important: they just might be "the task at hand". In code a seemingly-simple change can explode in your face to become complex as fuck, so it's a good idea to have your mind in an organized and simplified (todo list driven imo!!!) state before tackling ANY problem. You'll often not know the solution will be complex until you start it. Commit early, commit often. Commit ONE 'thing' at a time. Increments, baby steps, lists-created-on-the-fly in <Project>/design/initial.design.<project>.txt files like I just did for the first time ever recently. Sanity. Quality code. [Safe and Secure and] Right-or-Good-Enough. Safe and secure being implied/mandatory in every case (which makes mentioning it redundant ;-P). Right or good enough.

I predict SocialNetworkTimeline will simplify my life, once I am actually using it. A todo list feature/module/whatever will obviously be one of the key factors to that (but honestly my root todo.txt is DECENTLY timeline'd by git (and I could write a tool to 'import' those "git-tracked todo.txt changes" into SocialNetworkTimeline's todo list (as "already done" entries ofc... importing the ones not yet done doesn't seem like it'd make sense (in that tool), I'd just copy/paste them manually into SocialNetworkTimeline's todo list))!).
