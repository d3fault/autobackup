If I was an alien exploring the universe looking for other lifeforms, and I came upon earth, I wouldn't make contact. I'd study the "most intelligent" lifeforms on the planet, observe that they're STILL in a primitive state where they allow their fellow species to die of starvation (in 3rd world countries etc), then reason "if I needed help and was about to die, they wouldn't help me, so fuck that I don't need 'friends' like that". I'd move on trying to find another planet with lifeforms that aren't so shitty, but I'd periodically check back to see if the earthlings ever grew out of it.
