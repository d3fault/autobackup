Feeding your senses gives your os of life much more unpredictable (and therefore exciting (and therefore enjoyable)) information to work with, compared to closing your eyes and synthesizing a scene in your head. There is simply way more going on in the universe than in your puny little brain. This is necessarily true, since the universe "contains" (had:consists of) my brain (os of life).
