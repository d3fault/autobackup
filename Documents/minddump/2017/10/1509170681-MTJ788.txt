If you don't know the solution, restate the problem and maybe possibly try to simplify it further (the simplification is what leads you to the solution, probably most of the time [you discover the solution]).

The problem, as Baraka and Koyinaasqatsi put it (my interpretations of them):
We like fucking evolved from nothingness and each of us is amazing. We all have the right to direct our lives (as long as we're non-harmful), but the business-mode of living has created a great deal of situations where humans are being controlled by other humans for significant (sometimes majority) periods of their lives. This is called slavery and everybody is against slavery if you are able to point it out and label it. We do not have slavery over the table but instead have slavery under the table. It is not "official" (arbitrary) or "legal" (arbitrary too, but logical as fuck), but is instead implicit and [I-forget-the-word-that-comes-here-which-I-thought-up-before-even-starting-this-doc].

If your employee doesn't do what you say, you fire him, right?
Checkmate.
