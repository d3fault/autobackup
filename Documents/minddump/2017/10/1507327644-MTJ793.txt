these various subjects were written on my whiteboard, the preceeding line is the context clue I wrote.


love, but
Never ruin a good "I love you" by following it up with "but, <...>".


chappy
Saw the Chappie movie a couple months ago and liked it overall, but there was one part I saw that pissed me the fuck off. It was practically the climax of the movie, too. Was when Chappie accessed "all human information" on the internet. Fucking horseshit, Chappie would have died. "Oh shit the solution to the consciousness copy/transfer problem is scattered among hundreds of in-accessable (due to Copyright Restrictions) documents, I am dead". End movie.


inverse prop
There's an inverse correlation between how thoroughly I wipe my ass and the rate at which I bathe. I don't bathe very often.


"..."
On my tombstone, I want it to read: "I want to blow my fucking brains out, but first ..." -d3fault. The key is the elipsis. My entire [interesting] life is within that elipsis. In some weird fucking crazy twisted logic, wanting to commit suicide saved my life.


"pray"
I pray to god I never have to kill anyone. I don't even believe in god, but it can't hurt. Worst case I'm just wasting time praying, but this is a human fucking life we're talking about here.


disconnect/connect
re: on some thps soundtrack (either 1 or 2), one of the lyrics is "it's in our nature to kill"
disconnect(allThatEnergyIhaveInsideJustClawingToGetOut, SIGNAL(erupt()), world, SLOT(kill()));
connect(allThatEnergyIhaveInsideJustClawingToGetOut, SIGNAL(erupt()), world, SLOT(createAndPublishArt()));
//aka "channel your energy into creativity". qt4-style connect syntax used for verbosity (don't worry if you don't understand this sentence, it's techie).


this one wasn't written on whiteborad: I live in the future. In the above paragraph it says createAndPublishArt, and not createAndPublishArtForSale. In some trains of thought, fuck David Lynch motherfucker. But back to the point, I live in the future. I'm able to [continue] live[ing] the art life and since I am doing it early on, I'm able to take money out of the  equation. All human information should be in the public domain. In most trains of thought, I fucking love David Lynch and watching The Art Life made me like him even more. My synthesized mental image of him was much different from who he showed himself as in that movie. I thought he was just a quirky movie director with interest in pushing dark art, not a dark artist. meh that's cheese delete that part following the comma, too late I wrote it. Naw but he humanized himself a shit ton more in The Art Life, ofc. Like uhh the PURPOSE of his movies became clear[er]. He's an artist, and through his art he both expresses himself and changes the world [for the better, since he reads as a good (wonderful) person to me]. The biography made me more unquestioning of my own lifestyle in this here cabover camper. Weed, coffee, and code; trannys enter into it a little bit, but that's IT. jk about the ladies (trannys used to say "women", but I editted it for lulz) part, I'm striking out hardcore (I need to fucking re-launch and then the sluts will start flowing [eventually]). Hell I'm starting to like ugly girls more. Like ehh hot girls just aren't even worth the effort, for reals. Unless I tell them I'm a successful computer programmer and fuckin ACT the part and LEAD THEM ON that I'm gonna marry them and have babies with them [soon], hot girls have no interest in me. I know I'm attractive enough, but I don't want to be the tool they want me to be. Anyways back to Lynch: I am already living the art life, I've just never used that phrase before. I should code MORE though, I tend to fuckin laze around thinking/talking myself into depression. Coding seriously helps with depression. I've come to terms with it though, definitely super extremely fucking depressed (that being said, I am feeling kinda good at the moment (SUPER VARYING ROLLER-COASTER)). Humanity is just depressing. I know I'm so smart but I'm still so powerless. "do what you can", a girl in my imagination says to me in response. I can do a lot, that's the thing. It's just an uphill battle every step of the way. People who genuinely belive they ARE good (and they are, because INTENT is what defines a man) are the ones putting up the fight! What the fuck do I do about _THAT_? There's honestly not enough time for me to "explain" to them all and pursuade them. Pursuading even a single person to give up their power would take the rest of my [pre-frozing] life. Fuck. For many many good people, money is life.

I live in the future. I am guarding my art vigilantly, ensuring money does not contaminate it. I live in the future because I am able to do that. Most are not. Stuck in the rat race for their entire [probably-NOT-pre-frozing] life. See? Depressing as FUCK. My own loved ones. And yet I can do nothing. Intelligence is a curse. Intelligence can-be* a curse.
