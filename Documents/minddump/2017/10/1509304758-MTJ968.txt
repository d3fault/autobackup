I love the look on a hot-or-relatively-pretty girl's face when you ignore them and hit on the ugly girl. They look so genuinely confused! "Why is he hitting on that fugly bitch and not me?". It's because you, hot girl, expect way more out of me and will manipulate me into being "the submissive alpha male" (submissive at work (either to employer or the market as a whole), but alpha in appearance BRO). Fokken: there is an inverse correlation between "how freely I can express myself" and "the attractiveness of the girl I'm with". 10/10 science logic wholy shiet probably the smartest thing I've every said/written/thought/deduced/concluded/stated/theorized/claimed.

Backstory: was at laundry shop and hitting on some "eh"-looking tweaker bitch (don't kiss them and wear a rubber and you're golden) and a much hotter employee gave me that look of confusion :-D. The girl that gave me the look was later getting chatted up by a fellow who, just by appearance alone, I might theorize are "submissive alpha males", so yin and yang.
