A human comes to a fork in the road:
a) Live filthy rich, with a guilty conscience
b) Live dirt poor, with a clear conscience


(a) lives with a guilty conscience unless they are in denial, or they are simply unaware that they are doing harm, or they think they are evil and are doing it for fun, or they really are evil and are doing it because they don't give a fuck


my only options are (b) and (a).evil, so obviously Im (b)
I (had:with)... I'm trying to make a joke here: I wish my DENIAL module was stronger!


Not every human comes to that fork in the road. In fact I'd say most don't.
