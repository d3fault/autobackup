I fucking love taking a shit in the wilderness and burying it with a shovel. It might be a sort of semi-sexual (hardly, mostly not I'd say (unless subconsious ofc)) fetish, I'm not sure.

It is because:
a) I like enriching the soil
b) I like being legally publically nude for a brief period of time
c) A reflection of my disgust for [most all] public restrooms in general? This could certainly be subconscious, you know? Like I could have developed an "aversion" to public restrooms and that makes it SEEM like shitting in a hole in the wilderness and burying it is "fun" (and what SEEMS fun, IS fun (sometimes life doesn't give you lemons but in fact gives you strawberries :-D))
d) all of the above
?



(d) definitely (d)!!!!!
