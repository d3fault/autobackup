Even when the law is used to enforce the preferences of the majority, it is still an abuse of the law. The law must only be used to prevent harm to humans. We, the majority, do not have the right to make mere unpleasantries illegal. To think otherwise is to be a baby who wants to always get their way.

White on black slavery existed for so long simply because whites considered blacks unpleasant. Racism, however, is a form of evil much easier to spot. That one specific instance of "the majority population using law to make illegal unpleasantries" (slaves were not "legal" in the sense that they weren't considered human; they had no rights) eventually was overturned once the collective consciousness snapped the fuck out of it (and _KILLED_ those who didn't (dat civil war doe)) and realized it was evil... but what I'm saying is that there are potentially infinite (I'd estimate at least millions) "unpleasantries made illegal" in our "modern" age, that will always be made illegal through the will of the majority; and that is immoral.
