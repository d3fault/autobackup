wrote on my whiteboard "must music (lol pun)"
a) I have to listen to music while coding so people walking by my camper don't hear my keystrokes. I am afraid of their fear. A guy doing computer shit in a cabover camper would frighten those who jump to conclusion (most).
b) Yeaaa I gotta MAKE music because I'm fuckin sick of my tiny playlist but eh (a) makes me tolerate it. wasdf/MusicFingers incoming
