The Golden Rule: "Treat others as you want to be treated", actually has an exception.

Some people like to be treated like shit. Some people like to be [sex] slaves (etc). Those people should NOT follow the golden rule: they should NOT treat others like [sex] slaves (etc).

So perhaps the Golden Rule needs to be revised: "Treat others as you think they want to be treated, as reasonable people, if you yourself were a reasonable person".

^It's worded carefully to not assume (like the orig) that all people WANT to be "reasonable" (fuck and love that word) people. Some people get their kicks from being treated like shit. I sort of understand it (Dominatrix pls do..... things.... to me), but I'm not as crazy into it as some (masochists).
