I don't think weed should be able to be purchased at stores! That makes it too easy! Skateboarding around some new town trying to FIND weed is half the fun! Hint, it's kinda like that "warmer/colder" game: ghetto = warmer, richer = colder. Just follow your nose!

So yea anyways I'm totally against weed being legally sold at stores because of that perfectly valid reason: takes the fun out of finding weed on skateboard.


Man unfortunately my audience is too damn stupid so I have to clarify that this doc is sarcastic. That being said, I do kind of enjoy skateboarding around new towns.
