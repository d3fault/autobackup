mental jumprope

If I wasn't a programmer, I'd be a tranny. Shit is just way too time consuming tho. it would be from lack of better things to do. coding > trappin.

They, like I would think anything, are fuckin mental jumprope. They keep the mind busy.
How simple can you get your while true loop?
Before it becomes so simple that it's no longer *interesting*.

How tight can you optimize those loops? (for the hooker trap analogy, I'm comparing [code efficiency] to methamphetamine). Tuco would have loved Modern C++.


It should be illegal to be a tranny hooker without being also on methamphetamine.
It should be illegal to synthesize (or sniff out) a conspiracy without first taking Economics 101 and understanding supply/demand. I hear way too many conspiracy theories that don't answer the "why?" (which is usually "money"/power/any-form-of-power) and for that reason alone are unplausible. But then again, the main ones I do hear tend to be the same and sometimes reasonable (illuminati etc). Illuminati is by definition unknowable. As soon as you single it out and point your finger at it, it's no longer illuminati. Just some fuckin guy who will now go to prison. A single chain link in the machine that can synthesize (and install) it's own replacement chain links on demand ("pour metal here:" [ ]). "pour metal here:" is what it is equivalent to (had: what it looks like) to some rich ish entrepreneur who starts up the replacement business to fill the gap that the man (who may have PREVIOUSLY been the illuminati) that went to prison created (when he went to prison).
