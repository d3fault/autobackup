capitalist liberals
the "aggressively squeezing" attitude that a capitalist shows a resource, is the very same attitude that "democrats"/"liberals" show, except that the "resource being squeezed" by the liberal is the government itself.
So it makes me giggle when I hear capitalist republicans complain about the attitude of the liberal democrat.
