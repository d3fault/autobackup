Philosophers and physicists both try to explain the world, but they take completely different approaches. Philosophers tackle the problem from a more "top down" perspective, physicists from a more "bottom up". Philosophers try to whip up succinct explainations using just their brain, whereas physicists go around measuring everything and trying to figure out the complex interplay of the various aspects of nature. Physicists and philosophers seek the same thing: truth/understanding. Philosophy factors in the constant (for now) stream of new information that physicists pump out, but the opposite isn't true: physicists don't give a flying fuck about what the philosophers have to say (unless they are themselves part-time philosophers).

All that being said, I don't know which approach will "discover" the "truth" first.
