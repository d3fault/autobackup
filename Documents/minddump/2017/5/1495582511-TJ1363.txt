When you're russian, and I always find myself russian when I'm "on the clock", and employers tend to put pressure on their code monkeys because they want the most bang for their buck (they usually aren't aware of the "choose 2 of 3" thingy relating to code: good, fast, cheap)... err this sentence is hard to continue but anyways when I'm rushing I tend to NOT push separate pieces of functionality into their own class (like I should). It's only when I'm relaxed and coding at my own pace do I stop and think "hmm this isn't really related so I should make a class and hasA that class". When russian I tend to make giant monolithic classes that have assloads of special one-time-use member variables and methods and it's hard to decipher what's related to what. Fuck business-minded people.
