There's no need for them to have even remotely close time scales. But I think there's an upper limit in that a [sub-or-parent]universe can't go INFINITE times faster (or slower maybe in the case of parent (or both or neither)). It has to use the same laws of physics as us but the concept of time is completely relative to the experiencer (was tempted to put observer).
