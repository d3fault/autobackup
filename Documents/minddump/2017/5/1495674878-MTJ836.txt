I made it my goal in life to live in a cabover camper and to have DDRaceNetwork (a Teeworlds mod) be my "baseline" in life (that game is so fun and relaxing... but still of course dumb like all games are). I'd get bored of it after some hours and could then go on to code stuff. Well I got the lifted 4x4 truck and the cabover camper and am at this very moment up in the California mountains... but I failed at reaching that goal (for now) because my $35 linux computer doesn't have proper 3D support... so DDNet runs at ~2 fps facepalm.jpg. On the other hand I'm coding my ass off for lack of better things to do (can't hike ALL day EVERY day (well could but... don't want to...)).
