re: maintaining a monolithic git repo encapsulating all my git submodules, as a failsafe backup strategy, but avoiding dupe code

I haven't thought this through very much but here goes nothing: what if for my monolithic (backup) repo I use a symlink to projects I want to use (as libs (submodules)), and somehow intelligently swap them out for traditional submodules for the proper/git-submodule repos. I'm pretty sure git handles symlinks the right way (by not ENTERING the symlink), so eh there might be something here. Maybe my monolithic commit-helper app could parse the git config of each submodule and then know which subfolders are git repos (and to treat them like symlinks instead). You know in all honesty while this does sound possible (esp if using libgit), it sounds way the fuck too complex/confusing so fuck this shit
