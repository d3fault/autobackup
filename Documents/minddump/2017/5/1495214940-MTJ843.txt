Life is too short to put up with bad weather. It's bad enough I sleep a 3rd (or more!) of my life away, but on top of that bad weather can confine you indoors (or just generally restrict what you can do outdoors) for a 3rd (or more (esp in AZ, where it's more like half)!) of the year. Bah the "sunshine tax" is totally worth it. Weather is why I went to Hawaii to consider living there, and ultimately [one of the reasons] why I came to live in CA.

I don't know how those fuckers deal with snow, I don't think I could hack it (but they are probably thinking the same thing about AZ's heat (and they're not wrong! both extremes suck)).
