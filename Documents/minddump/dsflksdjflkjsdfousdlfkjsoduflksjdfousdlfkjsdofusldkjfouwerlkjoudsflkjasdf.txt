I'm excited and like "wtfz" at the same time that the only thing I have to LifeShape left is my "autobackup" folder (QuickDirtyAutoBackupHalper, the very thing this doc will get committed with!). Excited because FUCK YEA SO GOD DAMN CLOSE (have said this so many times (and this (and this (blah)))), "wtfz" because I can't determine if I'm allowed to continue adding docs to my autobackup folder as I am running the LifeShaper app (should it take multiple days... like the other sections did). It's weird to think that I'll be seeing this very doc while running LifeShaper... hopefully sometime in the next few days but idk tbh because idk when I'll be alone next. Oh cool a segueeuaueuaeua into my next doc...
