Meh at least I admit my contradictions:
a) Any form of security (such as encryption) can only ever buy you TIME, since everything can be brute forced
b) Security through obscurity is not security at all. All it does is SLOW YOUR ATTACKER DOWN


So err ehh uhmm doesn't that mean security through obscurity _IS_ security then O_o? I think that it's not a black and white picture. Security through obscurity may slow down your attacker, but then it's a matter of how intelligent he is in deciphering your obscurities. Real security (encryption/etc) buys a SET (or relatively set) amount of time. It doesn't matter how smart your attacker is, he must throw raw resources at your security in order to break it. Still a funny contradiction though...
