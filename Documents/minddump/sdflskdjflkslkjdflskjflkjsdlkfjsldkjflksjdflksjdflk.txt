I just realized the comp in my pocket only protects ONE thing [of value] now: bitcoin private keys. My complicated backup scheme I was using it for is now/finally moot. Maybe I should eh promote it to a "signing" box, just because signatures look sexy af imo (that they buy you authenticity/integrity is just a bonus ;-P).
