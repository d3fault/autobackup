The human most likely to succeed is the one that hits the sweet spot right in between being brought up in a well off family and still not being a trust fund baby. The opportunity to soak up knowledge is given to them from the fact that they were brought up in a well off family, and the desire/hunger/need/want to succeed is given to them by the fact that they don't have the rest of their lives already bought and paid for.

I hit that sweet spot.
