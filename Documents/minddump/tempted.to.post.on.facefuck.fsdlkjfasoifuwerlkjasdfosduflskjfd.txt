rare is as frequent as often, when dealing with infinity

if something happens once, then it happens infinite times

with infinity, there is no scale except 0 (does not exist) and 1 (exists)

to say something happens 1% of the time makes no sense...

...because there is no upper limit to infinity
1% of infinity is also infinity
