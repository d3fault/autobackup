Scenario: Nazi Germany during WW2: Imagine there's the internet back then. If the Germans posted the propaganda that their government fed them on the internet, other countries (namely US) could point out to them, using sound reasoning/logic, how that propaganda is brainwash getting them to do evil/unethical/immoral things. Now imagine the posts on the internet can't be copyright infringing. It would be illegal for the Germans to post the propaganda, thus impossible for other[s|countries] to comment on whether or not they're brainwash.
(Anti-Brainwash > Anti-CopyrightInfringement), otherwise you're pro-Nazi. <-- Damn here I go again proving myself a fukken baller at politickin'.
^Ok sure so "you're pro-Nazi" is kind of the "gotcha, sucker" way of presenting the argument. Here's a more realistic/PC logic traversal:
If you value the defense of copyright infringement over the defense of brainwashed citizens, you're paving the way to for an evil, propaganda-driven, pretending-to-be-good-because-it-defines-good, era of government.

^An aside: we're probably already in that 'era of government' ;-P... but it's impossible to prove because of the whole 'government-defines-good' thing
