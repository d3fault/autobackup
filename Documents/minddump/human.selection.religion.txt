human selection religion
yay diffs

anyways

only the good live on
pass their seed
pass on life
that is why religion exists
they may be less intelligent
but they want to be "GOOD"
this quality is attractive to women (unless we're talking about one-night-stands, which i utterly fail at)
so you pass it on
as well as your made up religion
i don't think there was a single starting point
although i used to think it was a conspiracy made up by 1 guy or a group of guys just to control people into being good because they saw it as being needed for the survival of the human race
but i think it just started as an idea that eventually just became fact because it was mentioned so much and ideas just piled on and i don't have any idea why they'd write books n shit but i mean for fun (odyssey etc) or to metaphorically** pass on their thoughts on how to behave. but the bible does refer to itself as unquestionable fact. but (double but) the bible is also written by many people. maybe the guys who say it's unquestionable fact were just fucking trolls. their entire chapters should probably be disregarded. or they were delusional, which isn't so hard to believe considering all the delusional people that exist today.
