fingers should be used privately publically (toggleable via sliding something(panel?)), publically as in i am walking around in public and yet i am dictating using fingers in a private manner. i know it is private because my persons (and therefore subconscious) is covered up and i am not using any networking hardware. the physical connection between the private hardware and the public hardware is severed when going into private mode. the private hardware machine and/or machinery can be in what i would refer to as "output only" (the security usage).
i should visually inspect (since it is on my persons/suit) the "network separation" (which is output only ANYWAYS) for added confidence. also the integrity of the suit must never be phsically compromised at any point while wearing or otherwise. a remote control robot cannot be slipped in to re-attach the connection which i had watched sever (or perhaps indirectly severed myself (perhaps directly also)) in order to be sure i was in private mode. i hide in my oversized stomach'd mecha in a sound proof ball (bullet proof etc too would be nice) or at least enclosure while in private mode. nobody can see my body because as the news and words have told me recently (i read it in a psychology book too recently, funny) (and of course i feel like my brain/hdd is hacked as usual) that our subconsciences are easily readable. i mean shit i've said that plenty of times before, and so have other people. what's with the sudden influx of talking about it? i saw it on a late night show (haha fuck you proprietary), on a warez release blog (ditto), and before both of those read it in a psychology book that i got from college. seriously just 2 weeks ago tops, and saw the other two in the past 2-3 days. mfw am i hacked right this very moment? HELLO?
