Modding communities cannot exist (without "permission") for "All Rights Reserved" (lol @ contradiction: all rights aren't reserved if permission is given (all sans one)... but you get the idea) content. Fuck that shit, modding is what got me into computers/programming in the first place (we didn't have "permission", but we exchanged only diffs of halo maps so I think we were in the legal clear (shit I just contradicted my entire statement! Except not all mods are diffs. Some require permission. If you are modding the entire content and redistributing it: you need permission (song remixes, for example)). Modding is a good way to make a nub feel like 1337 sauce. The feeling will remain until you actually become 1337 sauce and see how stupid you were :-P. The "feeling of 1337 sauce" is important and helps keep a person interested. They get direct results and are able to "jump right in" without understanding all of the underlying technicals. Read a tutorial on how to replace a model/projectile/skin/etc and they get the satisfaction of "hacking" quick and easy.

Also reverse engineering sucks (certainly not implying I don't have mad respect for those that can and do do it) and tons of time is saved when source code is made available (and modifiable/redistibutable ofc).

Fuck "All Rights Reserved".
