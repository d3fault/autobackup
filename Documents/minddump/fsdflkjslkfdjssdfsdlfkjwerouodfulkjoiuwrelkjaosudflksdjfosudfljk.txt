Lock on door keeps my mom from coming in and asking me dumb questions (Love her, but seriously I don't care what we're having for dinner etc etc. NOT worth bringing me "out of the zone" (so hard to get into in the first place (except not anymore I feel like I'm permanently in it and love it))).

Headphones keeps me from hearing Lexi (pity/guilt invoking), Caydon (ditto), Mom ("hurr nobody will walk with me" (had headphones off at that time)), and..... the main fucking reason: Dad yelling, breaking things, being loud so we know he's there (loudly opening drawers in kitchen etc), talking to himself, and listening to TV retardely loud because he's deaf. Love him too, but I don't have the time/patience etc to fight his battles for him (shit isn't even possible really (shrinks only TRY [to get them to fight their own battles?])). Honestly of all the capitalists on the planet, he'd be the hardest to convince (though I could be wrong because I don't know that many people). I do fear him in some senses because I think he's gonna snap and fucking kill us all and himself. BUT if I don't provoke him or argue with him (which MEANS NOT TALKING TO HIM (and he complains that I don't haha) unfortunately), I'm not too worried about it.


Seriously have had that lock on my door working for like 4 days and yet it's been the most productive 4 days in.... probably my life. Maybe when I was getting $12/hour to pump out code I might have had more productive days. Man what a jip that was... even though yea it was fun etc and I learned a lot (honestly I value the knowledge learned at that internship over the money easily)...
