There is only one me right now right here. There might be more than one me right now (if infinite space, there are infinite me right now). I was thinking about infinite-multiverse-unique timeline key IDs. There is "position + time", which gives you uniqueness for all of the [singular] known universe. If we ran into ourselves that was a duplicate in TIME, we can offset our times by which repeat it was (relative to each other, adapting as more are found). If we ran into ourselves that are experiencing the same NOW (ignore the fact that if i go left, so must the other me, and so we'd never meet xD). Well anyways, once we do manage to meet somehow fuck if I know how (possible through third party communication/collaboration (but then the two versions of myself split in order to go meet one another (one goes left, one goes right) muahahah so nvm again)), there's still the "merged spatial positioning" that comes afterwards, and so my RIGHT HERE although relativly identical to my other me right now's RIGHT HERE, once merged spatially (similar to the time merge "instance N"), becomes differentiable. There is only one me right here right now.
