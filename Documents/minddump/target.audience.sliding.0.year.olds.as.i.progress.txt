i found my target audience
0 year olds
those who are being born now
always
as in, my target audience right now are those being born right now
and my target audience when i'm 60 should be those being born when i'm 60

speak to them as if they already had all of your previous[ly documented] knowledge

or something?



i was thinking about who my generation is
who the minds will be that think like i do
i am technically currently insane because i am an outside of the norm human being
but that's not a bad thing!
it just means that everybody else has yet to catch up
and if i am a 'bad' insane, i am locked up so as not to influence/inflict-bad

everybody knows an insane person can make another insane
it depends on both of their brains whether it actually happens
for example, i think i would be immune to a couple months of only talking with a comitted person
years, maybe not
everybody has a breaking point before they too become insane

i would love to talk to a mirror like in mirror mirror on house
just watched some of the random old eps, shit's great

not only was foreman the only person to use the knowledge he gained from the mirror
he was also the only person to BE ABLE TO speak directly into the mirror and speak with it (himself)
everybody else acted dumbfounded or tevs lost train of thought thinking about cutner saying "yea" after "i love hot-tubs" and then later saying "i hate hot-tubs" lol plot hole
