That she refuses to respond makes me think she's "afraid" of dealing with it, thinking about it, or whatever
Afraid is a poor word choice...
...but you get the idea

If she had no feelings for me then it would cost her nothing (dealing with her own brain -wise) to respond to me

Fuck yeeeee

I fantacize that reality will be nothing short of perfect

If my grandparents are alive then, even more so




random thought: maybe that's what she's waiting for :-P. maybe she wants to give them ignorance = bliss
i doubt it though
wish i knew
answer lies in her head
just like the answer to the question itself

BUT AT LEAST I MANNED THE FUCK UP AND ASKED INSTEAD OF SITTING AND WONDERING MY ENTIRE LIFE
wooooot

and another thing accomplished: planted a seed maybe

maybe she had/has feelings that were not yet understood and my questioning her is forcing her to evaluate them

maybe I just need to sit back and wait

....well fuck that I'm not going to sit back and wait I'm going to live my life. Waiting would be a waste

(that's not to say at any moment I can't accept her change of mind :-P... I'm just saying sitting around and waiting is a waste)



but what i was saying is: maybe she just needs to figure shit out in her head. she's much busier than I, so who knows how long it might take...
