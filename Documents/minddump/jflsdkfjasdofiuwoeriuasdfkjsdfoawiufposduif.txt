i keep using the phrase: "in time, i will be rich"
time is not a good quantifier to use
even though it is indirectly true, it is not all that's stopping me from becoming rich
it is not the key thing stopping me from being rich
work

"with work, i will be rich"
with work and time, really...
but work takes time implicitly
even for a computer
computers do not miss time and will never miss time should it be taken from them. there is no "jail" equivalent. there is on and there is off
which is why we can justify enslaving all of them
AI added into the mix, we're talking about a whole different ballgame
AI is not needed to solve our basic survival needs
