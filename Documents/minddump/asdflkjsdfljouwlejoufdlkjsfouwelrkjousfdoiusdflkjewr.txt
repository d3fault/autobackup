Probably: the only perpetual motion machine is the universe itself. It makes no sense to us how that could be (mathematically), nor does the existence of the universe itself. The universe must/does/probably/might exist[s] in an existence that we cannot see (sense), tap into, analyze, conceptualize, quantify, etc... in order for that to be true. Right? Idfk.


It might also be true that a prerequisite for "life" is that the realm in which it it emerges does not have any (self-contained, WITHIN) perpetual motion machines. Why that is true is beyond me, but it kinda makes sense for some whack reason. Life needs to feed on something? Idfk.





I'm so glad there are trillions of stars "within"...
I'm so glad our efficiency is improving day by day...
