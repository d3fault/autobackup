Why oh why did I have to emerge into a freedom of information dystopia this time around -_-??? It really cramps my style (because I am the same (the word same is used very lightly here) in each). I know I can have emerged into worse/better universes (times), but meh this one I'm in seems almost completely corrupt and lost. It makes suicide seem like a decent option. In fact suicide doesn't even sound scary anymore. I know I _CAN_ do it. I just won't remember that I ever did it. Decrease the odds by a shit ton (there's still the vegetable problem though so perhaps it's still a terrible idea :-/ (surely there's a guaranteed way to snuff out all the odds (infinite variations means infinite chances of survival means NOPE NO GUARANTEES HAHAHAHA OWNED)?)).

At least I have computers (but what am I missing from a few thousand years from now GAH). I'd imagine in most all instances there's some "grand problem" that needs to be solved, so my complaining is synonomous. But surely it's possible to emerge a couple thousand years from where this one will be (should it even still exist (I guess I should say: should life still exist -- because THE (1) universe always will (even if there are multiple, only one is needed for infinite multiverse theory woo))). To be born into the improvements that my sorry ass has been working on for a few thousand years (should I still be alive) would be splendid. Art, code, bliss. Love.
