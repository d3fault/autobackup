I will not interact with you in a manner that cannot be shared. Knowledge needs the ability to spread. We can use Copyright to our advantage by requiring the ability of our works to be required to be sharable. Our works are "expressions" of us. Expression-timeline? Getting back to the point, blah blah blah I think I actually had something to say here. Oh yea, our works are our interactions with others as well. Every CAPTURED or otherwise something fixed to a medium or whatever that consists of the 24/7/365. It is a new type of society and maybe not everyone will like it. Nobody should be forced into it (when to start with children? (we should start with children because we have to because we have to interact with them and give them knowledge)).



I will enter modes of non-sharing (such as if I wanted to interact with my sister while she was crying at christmas and i was trying to make a sarcastic snyde remark saying how she was the one who was creating the drama (something like ""), and when i saw her turn and saw her crying i MODIFIED MY BEHAVIOR for her (started acting) so as not to make her feel worse) but will flee back to the sharing-required mode because Acting will become equivalent to not existing. In a sense it is true (Your unmodified natural self as it would stream from you if you were to disregard all of humanity from this point further (all previous interactions OBVIOUSLY still reflect in you because they are what you are reflecting)), but in a sense it is false (your physical being does not cease to exist). I had to add in those two parenthesis because without them it made very little sense.
