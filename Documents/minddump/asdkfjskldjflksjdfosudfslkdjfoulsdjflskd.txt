The video choose.mov on my legitimately-purchased Offspring Americana CD (first CD I ever got :-P) that I didn't even know existed (never stuck it into a PC until now) made me listen to the words (in combination with the video (lawled when the guy stepped out of baggage carrier jammin)) much closer than ever before (even looked them up because I thought he was saying "or not choose" instead of "And I choose" :-D). Idk just err leik inspiring is all I guess keke hurr he's just like me :-). Gives me confidence to jump off the cliff.

Tempted to talk shit on the fact that he's proprietary bullshit, but hey, we all sell out. I'm just selling out before I'm selling out and I'm much better at it than most (building my own ad thingo). I'm also much slower at it than most :-/.
