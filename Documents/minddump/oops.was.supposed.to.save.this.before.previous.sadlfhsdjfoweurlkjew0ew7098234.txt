unlike money, intelligence and happiness do not have to come at the cost of others
government should provide a normal existence (excess is reward for, and incentive for, creative works. they buy each other) so that all of mankind (or, the human species) can be intelligent and happy without having to (and the most emphasis goes on the two words "having to") worry about money
as part of a tax on said community (an optional tax since excess is itself optional), food harvesting and sleeping rooms (with access to traditional hygeine shit) should be built by robots. they should also be able to build themselves (note:dangerous code section), maybe we always have a trigger for a robot being built and (was going to add a bit about making it illegal, but (idk)).

while saving, i was tempted to call this doc "intelliegence through internet", but then it got way long about idfk and
oh right, we can but don't have to store the internet/intelligence-distribution-servers among the robots
actually fuck that shit we should do it on ourselves AND the robots

to be honest, the ad agency detour was probably the worst in my life (was tempted to add "thing" after "worst" right there but that changes the meaning completely)

happiness, on the otherhand, will come from (just changed "this doc" from "it") the [optional] interaction with each other
