Went to church for my mom's birthday (couldn't stop laughing hysterically for the first few minutes). I wanted to take the micrphone and say: "I'm agnostic atheist but I want to take a scalpal and [word-for-precision-cut] the "good"-ness out of all of them and swap out the religion part for science. Science has a much more solid bond". Science holds up when questioned; anyone who questions religion finds serious logical flaws and then falls back and away (away from good people is an unfortunate side effect). Arbitrary Group Of Good Atheists (doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, but you get the idea...)
