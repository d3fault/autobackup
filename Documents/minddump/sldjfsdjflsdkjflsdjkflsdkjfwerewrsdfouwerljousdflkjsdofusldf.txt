The hacker (programmer) is to the normal computer user what the human is to all other animals in this existence (or perhaps I should say on this planet, since aliens might exist). Existence being the equivalent of an OS in the analogy. We are all hackers, whether we realize it or not. We are self aware applications with the ability to script ourselves in what is called "free will".

It sort of makes sense that it took/takes a computer hacker to make the connection. The computer is/was my "mirror"... similar to how a reflection in water/mirror helped the conscience become self aware.

I fucking love hacking.
