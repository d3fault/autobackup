honestly the closer and closer i get to launching, the more and more confident i become that d3fault is actually possible
full scale impossible to shut down / censor DHT d3fault
my fucking dream app

i get smarter and smarter
and more and more confident
can't wait to actually start it

going to be recording myself when i do :)

now back to this ABC shit, the revenue capturer behind the recording functionality.


ROFL talk about YAT

d3fault -> ad supported -> abc -> rpc -> generic ack



but wow

that's actually NOT THAT BAD

not that far i mean

do'able.

so close...
...yet so far :-P

fucken pumped.

real life awaits you -holy mountain
