software kids game
5 randomly selected letters
recursive function to show the same 5 letters over and over (randomly each time, never using same letter 2 times in a row (on ends)) except the ones they already got right
it says the letter at the same time that they type it
if they type the letter wrong, the computer kindly says "no, that was [pressed-button], you want [target-button]"



f & j are used often to keep the fingers in the correct position. we tell them to try to keep their pointer fingers at rest on f&j




animation to add after the fact: dinosaur eats the letter if he gets it right. the letter falls into a lava pit if wrong


might as well have a voice recognition input version for the droid/iphone-maybeidfk
