I should buy one whole stock of teh Gewg and then confront those noobs. If they say they prioritize social science, I sue them (or whatever the legal recourse is called) for not pursuing mah profetz. There's no winning, because they look like jackasses ("evil") when they say they don't prioritize social science. They'll probably reply with some political mumbo jumbo (responding by saying nothing), the pussies.
