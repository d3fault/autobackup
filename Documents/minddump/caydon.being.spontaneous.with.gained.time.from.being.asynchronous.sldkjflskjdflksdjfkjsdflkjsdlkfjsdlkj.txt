I taught Caydon what "asynchronous" means through an example: he powered on his computer and as it was booting up, he went to the bathroom. I told him that his doing so was asynchronous. So earlier today he powered on his computer, stood on his bed, did a silly/cute dance, then went back to sitting in his chair and remarked to me "I was being asynchronous". I told him it was extremely smart what he just did. I meant it. If he understands the arbitrarity of life at such a young age, he's a freaking genius.
