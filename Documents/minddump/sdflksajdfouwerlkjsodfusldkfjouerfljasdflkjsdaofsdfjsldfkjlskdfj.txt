Life/Existence is, from a completely analytical point of view, ridiciously dull. To the point where there is absolutely nothing of interest. It is our skewed perception which includes emotion that gives us the illusion of interesting (that which seems interesting, is). The reason life is boring to the ONLY-analytical mind (no human mind can be that, unless it is broken) is because every single thing in this universe conforms to the laws of mathematics. Life, to a pure analytic, is a straight line (or a dot, or whatever. the line may or may not be infinite). It is our emotional perception that ... metaphorically speaking... places an oddly shaped magnifying glass over that line and makes it do loop-de-loops and zig-zags and the like. You take the magnifying glass away (become a physicist (lul jab but seriously i love you guys)) and all you see is the straight line. Only through the human perspective [which involves emotion], which is incapable of dealing with "ridicously large numbers" easily.. or at least "quickly", does our ridiculously-precise(to-a-human-mind)-PRNG of a universe _SEEM_ interesting. A true RNG is not even a requirement... which is convenient because nobody can figure out how to make one.

Whether you call it emotion or "the creative side of your brain", I'm talking about the same thing here. That fucking unexplainable........ stuff. FEEL.


I suppose emotion is simply the result of sensory bombardment chaotically carving an operating system into your brain. Makes sense to me.


The universe IS difficult to understand, but I think I do understand it from a high level. I don't need that nitty gritty physics stuff... though I am still interested in it (and even moreso glad that others are doing it for me!).
