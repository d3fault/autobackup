A more minimal argument: You have to compete with others who are pursuing happiness in order to not die (had:LIVE). That's not "having the right to life".


There's no end to anyone's pursuit of happiness, they will continuously get as rich as they can, making it that much harder for those at the bottom (and there are always more children becoming adults) who are just trying to not die.
