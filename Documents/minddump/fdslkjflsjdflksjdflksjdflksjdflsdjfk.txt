I have unintentionally given myself light deprivation, aside from my closet light (lol typo: fromy), within the same day that i have also cut off my use of the online netbook (of which I primarily browsed qt, raspi, qc, xkcd, and porn (the golden five)). I wonder how long I'll last.

I watched Adaptation again (makes 3rd time (I think rofl wut)) and I definitely ripped it off in my letter. It was unintentional but the whittled bullshit (cheesy, but definitely conveys a certain message that I was trying to convey simply). Convey simply. That's what coding is. Previous two sentences are OT. It seemed longer, as if they went back and re-made it and took out other boring scenes and inserted scenes that make perfect fucking sense. I suppose this just means I didn't get it the first two times.

I know that it comes down to one of these three (TODOreq: try to think of a fourth, for the sake of seeing if I can manipulate myself from [... lol wut? the future? an ancenstor derivative (illuminati etc)?])
1) oh shit i forgot what I was talking about

Ok had to re-contextualize (should have been in red (hmm perhaps that fading color scheme would work here too (but the wiki idea is bettar))!(tbh idfk if that ecsclaimation (sp wtf) mark belongs there)) to remember that
[shit got stuck there for like 10 minutes and even let my head drop and eyes close]
the movie may have ripped me off, and that was one of the above three!

1) I ripped it off unintentionally
2) They ripped me off by hacking my hard drive and stealing it
3) I'm dumb and just don't remember it, oh wait no this is 1. I can't remember 3 for the life of me!
