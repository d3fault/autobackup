Already said in so many words:
How can I expect to be loved if I don't let anybody in? The problem is solved planwise, but I still want to remark on the sheer bullshit of it all.

It is INDIRECTLY effectively (true for ME!) this: copyright law is preventing me from finding love.

I know how silly it sounds and bawwww nobody likes a whiner, but really that's what I've deduced it to.

The feeling that I'm being listened to and/or spied on and that my words/etc will be stolen from me and attribution fucking JACKED (all for money zzz) makes me silent. Silence = can't communicate. Can't communicate = nobody let into me, my brain, my being, etc. Can't hold a fucking conversation. Can't do that, obviously unlovable. It's both ways though, I can't give my love either.

I'm about to burst like a flash flood of cum all over this world. So close and I can't fail (unless I die, but [...]).
