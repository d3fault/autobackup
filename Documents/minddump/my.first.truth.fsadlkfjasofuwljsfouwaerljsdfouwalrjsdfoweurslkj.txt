application that targets kids/babies (abc dinosaur game)
ads on it
selling yellow toy gun or some bullshit.
i am the game and the ad that pops up (though tor anon'd (i guess for both?))

mom says "oh do you want this toy?"
kid wins: gets toy
i win: get cash
mom wins: gets negative reinforcement for not watching their kid better

win/win/win
i think that may be faulty logic.
i am unsure
but pretty sure [that it's faulty]

[[no] [unsure] [dunno] [prettysure] [yes]]
there only needs to be that many

prettysure and yes are implied to be together by a great many
i use it for my own existence, for example
i am pretty sure i exist <-- 100% fact
i am not sure i exist <-- logically limits how sure i am to be something less than 100%
wow
my first truth
i am 100% sure i am pretty sure i exist
