kek some forest rangers on quads scoped me out a few mins ago. they paused briefly on the trail next to where I am, checked out my setup... camper + screen house (fkn flies) + solar panel + solar cooker... probably saw the trash bag I had hanging up (and no litter on the ground)... looked at me in the camper waving at them... then drove off (didn't even wave back :-/).
