I love it when I'm operating at full capacity. It's tough to trigger, but man oh man I just KNOW when I have that mega adrenaline rush and everything becomes crystal fucking clear.

I stumbled upon that thought while fantacizing rescuing other astronauts on Mars (their shit broke or something ya know) and... since I'd be life 24/7/365, the world would get to see me operate at full capacity (the goal of preserving life, even someone elses, can bring me there in an instant).


I work so fast it's amazing. I can't even think of the last time I've been at that capacity... but I know it's there. It's a euphoric adrenaline rush TRIGGERED FOR A FUCKING REASON.

The goal in this case would be like piloting a rover over to help them asep yada yada. Yea, lame fantacy I know :-P... but it could happen. (The reverse could also happen rofl -- all humans can make mistakes)
