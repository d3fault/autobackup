7:30pm and I'm already in bed, see what I mean? Was wearing a [long sleeved] t-shirt today but once the sun drops so does the temp almost instantly. No urban warming or whatever it's called (cement/buildings holding in the heat) out here, kek. I could stay up. Up as in "not laying down" rofl. I could stay up with long underwear on and huddle up next to the fire... that's what I've been doing for as long as I can tolerate before going in and laying in bed wide awake for hours on end. Heh,  this rig is so pro. I used/bent another hanger to hold the screen in place, just like with the hat rig. I've never been this warm while coding. Hell, I've never been this comfortable while coding. I predict wasdf/music-fingers will be more comfortable once it's out of such an alpha state (and I refuse to work on it until I can [affort do] record/broadcast the work that needs to be done. Fuck it, I'm patient.... *stabs self in the neck*. Yea quite a few years ago I wanted to saw a keyboard in haf for doing something extremely similar to this... except with a real/LCD monitor hanging from my parents' house ceiling. I gave up on it only because the soldering job looked too much of a pain in the ass. Not sure if I had wasdf in mind at the time, but I came up with both of them right around the same time. My right elbow is going to need something to rest on here in this ghetto rig, that's why I wanted to saw the keboard in half. I guess I could alternate which elbow is uncomfortable, or shit use one of the many objects in here to simply prop it up. A can of soup would do the trick.
