I think using logic you can land on both sides of the equation and that there's no right answer. I'm also quite sure that if I had love, I'd be on the other side of the equation. "Do the best with what you have". I'll likely spout when I'm near death: "eh lived a pretty good life... but something was missing..... probably love".
