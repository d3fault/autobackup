I hate this world because speaking is both legally and physically dangerous. I want to, and I will, be an explosion of words, defying the norm... setting precedent. Defining the norm. If it gets me killed (etc) then so be it... I don't want to live in that particular instance/universe anyways. Infinite multiverse theory kicks in. I AM MORE OR LESS THE SAME "STEVEN" IN EVERY VARIATION (though my name is obviously different). I just want freedom of thought, but I don't want to keep those thoughts bottled up and to myself (leads to, or is, insanity). I, Steven, am afraid of death... but I, the metaphorical spirit driving Steven forward (logic that discovers itself), am not.
