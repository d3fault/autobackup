I find it absurd in sheer principle (not taking other analysis of patent system into account) that medicine can be patented. "Hurr we have the cure to your death but you aren't legally allowed to assemble it, give us money hurr". Evil for Good comes to mind (they should be shot in the face).... but meh it's easier/safer/GOODer to just defy/ignore it (law) I'd say. I'd gladly take a "instructing others to break the law" charge in this case. I'd wear it proudly.
