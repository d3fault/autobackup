If I typed hahahahah[...] repeatedly infinte times before, and each time I genuinely found it hilarious (knowing full well I typed and laughed at it before), it doesn't mean it isn't funny. It is still funny each and every time.

Now it's just a matter of not getting bored of my warped perspective. Maybe the key to that is not understanding it!

Meh, that's a question I'll keep asking for a long ass time I'm pretty sure (so there's definitely time before I get bored if I ever do). Maybe that's the reason we reset. Err, not the reason... but.. a.. perk. OR SHIT MAYBE A REASON MAYBE IT IS EVENTUALLY WISE TO RESET (SHOTGUN TO THE FACE) just so you can re-experience confusion. I doubt that will be anytime soon and I hope it's never. "Hope". What a weak word.


In both computers and life: I don't understand everything... but I can't think of anything I don't understand... not including "low level" stuff such as physics, chemistry, kernels (actually I think kernels don't sound hard at all (but neither do the other two -- just a matter of memorizing bullshit)). I mean purely from a high level (life = logic, computers = application developer)... I feel pretty fucking smart and want to pat myself on the dick.

I was just staring at a picture of myself as a child and thought: "who woulda thought I'd grow up to understand the world..................... and then keep it all to myself".

Meh I need to launch ASEP. That's teh plan :-P.
