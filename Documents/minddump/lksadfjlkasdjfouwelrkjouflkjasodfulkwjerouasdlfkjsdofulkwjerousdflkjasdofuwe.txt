It is possible (therefore it is true?) that we are just a typo in a "godlike" being's code. A kajillion of our earth years may only be a fraction of a second to him. It is possible (therefore it is true?) that a typo will be our demise: robots created to defend us will propagate a bug that makes them destroy us. They won't be all emotional about it like fiction likes to depict. It is possible (therefore it is true?) that we could create the same typo in our universe and create another sub-universe that maybe only lasts for a fraction of a second (see above) and isn't even noticed by anyone.

I notice now and am enjoying it, that's all that matters.
