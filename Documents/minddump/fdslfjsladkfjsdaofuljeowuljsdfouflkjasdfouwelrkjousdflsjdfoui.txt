I can't push myself hard enough to invoke death [to prove that I cannot die]...
...because I won't die and I then determine that I haven't pushed myself hard enough.
Or something.

Basically what I'm saying is that we're all always way too cautious. You can't "test" death. The times where death became true, you cease to exist and can no longer test/utilize the information.
