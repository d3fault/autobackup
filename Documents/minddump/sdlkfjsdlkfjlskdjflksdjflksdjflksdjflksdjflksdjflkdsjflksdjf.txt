Why "Cleanroom" all of the sudden? I've been doing a LOT of thinking lately. Cleanroom is the only project that I can think of where I both want to do it and it will possibly turn a profit. It neutralizes some of the feeling of me being enslaved.


Entrepreneurs are slaves to the market, and employees are slaves to entrepreneurs. Politicians are in their own side system: "act well, attain power" -- slaves either to the constituents or profits or both. There are other side systems as well.
