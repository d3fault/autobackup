There's something cool that can be extracted/abstracted from the following formula I use to listen to music. It makes it so that I never turn on the music and it's TOO LOUD. TOO QUIET is acceptable... we can turn up.

My phone has a feature where whenever I plug in a headphone jack, the volume on the phone is set back to 50%.

So I turn on my speakers and set their volume to as low as they will go. I start playing the music from the phone. I then raise the speaker volume until I can hear the music even a tiny bit.

After I can hear the music a tiny bit, I raise the rest of the volume (I like my music "kinda loud") using the resetting volume on the phone. This way I can be somewhat certain that when I put on the music next time (or from a different source), it won't be loud as fuck to a bad level.


It sounds retarded but I keep analyzing it everytime I do it and I'm pretty sure the basic formula can be used somewhere else. It might even have something to do with that cool auto-adjusting formula I'm always looking for... but idfk...
