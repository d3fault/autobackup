I want to doit the code the softwares to help it the humans to get it the smarter to it the hivemind. I want to devote my entire fucking life to that. But I'm distracted (seemingly indefinitely) with simple problems such as "food and rent". I can't the code it the softwares to help humans get it the smarter to speed up the transition to hivemind at my parents house, I'm just not in my element here. I realized the other day that I have developed an aversion to my father's presence in the house. I feel great when he's not here, but when he's here (THE MOMENT I HEAR HIM WALK IN THE DOOR) my mood fucking drops. It's a subconscious thing, I'm not doing it on purpose. Even if he only has a real fit of rage once every 3 days, all 3 days are fucked because I'm expecting it.

I'm working on some stupid/experimental plans to get the fuck out of this house asep (like I said: while(!movedOut) ;). I'll write about them more if/when they develop. Re: "Life is beautiful, but society is fucking stupid" <-- Stupid problems warrant stupid solutions ;-). Abc2 wasn't stupid enough ;oP.
