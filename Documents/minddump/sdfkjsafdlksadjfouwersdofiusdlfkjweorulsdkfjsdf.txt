Curiosity is a priveledge for the bored.
Curiosity is a distraction for those with no direction.

Cognitive dissonance shows up everywhere lately~


I should note that I mean to have some sort of negative connotation attached to the word distraction. As in, it is a waste of time.

Elaborating further, I see it as cognitive dissonance because those who are bored are priveledged and it can SPARK CREATIVITY. It is a good thing in that sense.
