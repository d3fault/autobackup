when kaylee texted me: "Hey Cousin... you're a good kid [...]", it felt like universes were merging. maybe the path i seek is the path i get. it seems to turn out that way for the most part. my phone like glitched out and it was like a de-ja-vu type thing from the matrix. LUL. i mean android's pretty shit anyways so it was probably just that... the screen flickered and pixels blinked crazy over her name and the text's preview...
