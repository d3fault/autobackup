Regarding a mobile online rig, with a bitcoin "sub key" that has an amount of money that I _COULD_ bare to lose (but prefer to not): I can store the bitcoin wallet and/or private keys (semantics) decrypted on the rig I am carrying on my persons. Say, for example, I see a person charging at me with a sword drawn and it's obvious he intends to cut off my backpack straps and steal the moneys. I could rig it so that with one single touch of a button, the funds are all immediately sent to some other "ultra secure by long as fuck password" account (which I could log into later, and re-dispurse into a new sub-account). Carrying hot money could be re-secured with one button press (requires internet). Of course there are other strategies that could require one button press, such as always keeping the machine online and only storing a keyfile in memory (then shredding it at a button press), etc etc... but idk I like this one because it allows me to shutdown the machine still (do I even want to :-P)?

Nothing can ever protect from the "ripping off of finger nails" method of password retrieval.
