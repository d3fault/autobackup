Coding shit yourself definitely does reinvent the wheel from time to time, BUT the flexibility in customization (even if just from the fact that you understand the code base, let alone that it meets your EXACT requirements) gained after the fact almost always makes up for it. I rarely find myself hacking code that someone else wrote. There are certain things I would never code/reinvent-the-wheel on (video codec comes to mind), so it isn't set in stone.
