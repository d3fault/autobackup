re: Kaylee's fortune cookie "follow that restless urge to find yourself"

it should be DEFINE
i'm too much of a pussy to post the correction on fb (lol ironic?)
i just don't eh
i like i mean
i feel like i argue for the sake of arguing
like a kid in elementary school that is mean to a girl he likes

and she'd also say something like "thank you oh wise one" in response i bet :(

fuck it
back to actually defining myself (code etc!)


can't stop thinking about her lately though
want to call her and just talk
'see where the conversation leads'

i do feel relieved that i asked her out
but there's too much silence lately

awkward flirting (found out it was fake!) is better than silence :-/

i want to phone her and brute force through the silence/awkwardness

maybe a 1-2 hour phone call could do it

i wish we could just "hang out" :(
