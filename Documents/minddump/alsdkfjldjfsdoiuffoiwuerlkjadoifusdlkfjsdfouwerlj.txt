One place where kaylee/children are not the same is basic nudity. I am pretty sure that if I was a nudist only she'd be cool with it. Porn is entirely different and she probably wouldn't be cool with it. Cool = "Support" and/or be ok with (STILL TALK TO ME AFTERWARD HAHAHAHAHAHA), not necessarily like/watch in either case.

So children obviously can't view nudist content. Against the law which is pretty dumb but meh reality is reality, use as is. OH ALSO CHANGE IT BECAUSE YOU CAN, but pick and choose your battles (wisely!). I don't care about nudism/porn _THAT_ much. The Kaylee + worldly influence of getting in children's fucking heads (muahahahahahahaha <- the evilest laugh evar (except i'm a good person so not really (I am a good person because I choose to be))) is winning as of late. Fuck censorship but also fuck being censored (if you are nudist/porn etc, you _WILL_ be (at least in a lot of areas, but not completely)) censored. I see it as complying in a way but also in another sense, it's a "compromise so as to manipulate more humans". If my goal truly is to increase the average intelligence of all human beings (is, though I wouldn't die for that cause!), that compromise is easily worth it. I see the contradiction. I am not in denial of it. I punch myself for censoring myself and carry on. I can always uncensor myself completely later on should I get bored of children's material and/or Kaylee still not think me awesome enough to be worthy of her time ;-P. The opposite isn't true: can't uncensor and then later censor (uncensored content will "ruin" your name so to speak and all the censoring entities (most of them (FUCK YOU ALL I HOPE YOU ALL DIE A MISERABLE DEATH AND IF I COULD KILL YOU WITHOUT GOING TO PRISON etc, I WOULD)) will now censor you by name alone! It doesn't matter that you now censor yourself so as to be kid friendly. Once a name is ruined it can never be unruined. However I can always ruin my name later :-D. Makes perfect fucking sense really)
