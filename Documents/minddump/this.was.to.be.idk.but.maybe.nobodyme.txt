i can't type over myself, keyboard wise
but i also can't game reaching that far (see, this is a good time that i'd need backup-public opt-in, i put gaim there instead of game, then backspaced and fixed it. the opt in should be after the fact during a period of downtime. like now i just sat here thinking for about 30 seconds. right then would have beeen a good time to go back and acknowledge the thingy-ma-bob)
blaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh
stuuuuuuuuuuuuck
and there, i waited a good 30 minutes staring at the wall before typing blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
but stuck in a more prioritizing sense
i know what i want to do, but not in what order i want to do them
