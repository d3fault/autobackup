Life is simultaneously both a priveledge and a plague.

When I say priveledge, I don't mean the kind that "other people grant you".... just that it can sometimes be positive (whereas plague is clearly negative). s/Life/emotion


Cognitive dissonance: I am afraid I won't ever launch. Now that launching is at my doorstep (or I was tempted to write: now that I am at launching's doorstep (is there a difference?)), I am afraid of launching.

Both are definitely true.


I am ready to live. I am ready to die. Both sentences must be true in order for me to move forward. WTF?
