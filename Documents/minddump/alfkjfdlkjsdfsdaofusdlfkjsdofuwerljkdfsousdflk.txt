The general idea that a person is required to be "on notice" to comply with DMCA is what I will fight and win as a constitutional/human rights violation. In the contexts of COMPANIES it _barely_ makes sense, but I am going to one man army this shit (also don't play well with others) and simultaneously demonstrate the stupidity of the requirement.
