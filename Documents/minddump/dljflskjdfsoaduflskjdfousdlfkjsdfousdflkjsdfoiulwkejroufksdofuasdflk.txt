laughable dystopia (and a self referential)
We live in a laughable dystopia. That "News Corp" is able to trademark such a name is proof enough that they have influence where they shouldn't.

Woot, a self referential. Even though I hate circular dependencies, self referentials allow you to speak with 100% accuracy. I picked up on them and first started liking them while reading the GNU GPL. It's wording is carefully chosen so as to use the exact same wording that copyright law uses! What the judge/jury would interpret for a particular meaning is the same meaning applied to the Copyleft (works, derivative, etc etc). "What would be considered a derivative by copyright law must be licensed under this license" <3 <3 <3 <3 <3

The top line is a self referential because I do not say where the influence they have and shouldn't... even is. It's whatever portion of government handles trademarks/etc... which off the top of my head I haven't a clue [and dgaf].

Seriously: the smarter I get, the more reality seems like a shitty movie.
