My struggle is fucking retarded (I am retarded). I realized earlier today that all I need is "a desk and internet" (and no fucking distractions (especially the censoring kind)). So simple and I have all of it already except the censoring distractions. Parents shape us (even if we simply mirror them).


I want to walk around and shit with a video camera on my head, fuck rent. BUT I need a desk to assemble fingers/etc at, so I am fucked. I'd even settle for a delayed by a few hours/days upload at this point, but the desk problem still exists.


I think my mom enters my room and asks me incredibly stupid questions more frequently when she hears keystrokes, I shit you not I'm noticing a correlation. I feel bad for her insanity at least, my dad's makes him an asshole.
