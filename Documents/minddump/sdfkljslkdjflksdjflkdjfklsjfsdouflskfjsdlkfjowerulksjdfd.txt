I wanted to say to Robinson last night: "I like your art, and I am creating you". The context is what made it significant. We had both just realized to a good degree how much of the influence we have on kids around us. He told me that as a kid he always thought I was the coolest person. It made me realize that I probably heavily influence[d] his life. He was discussing how he's having a difficult time choosing between <something-i-forget-what> or art. I didn't say it because it wouldn't have been recorded/copyrighted/etc, could have been jacked. Pisses me off that I didn't get to say it, because saying it is creating/modifying him, and now he's heading in a different direction in life (he doesn't have that much more influence from me). Fuck copyrights/etc.
