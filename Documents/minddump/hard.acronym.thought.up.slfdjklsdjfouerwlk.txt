hard
human action recording device (lol'd SO FUCKING HARD when i realized the acronym afterward)
i will argue against any patent or copyright or legal claims of any kind my winning defense will be that it is a human right to use such devices, therefore no patents can prevent you from using them
the only reason it isn't a human right already is because computers and the internet (requirements for HARD) were only recently invented/discovered/whatever
fingers are merely a single module of the HARD system.
theoretically every human action, INCLUDING emotion (we just have to figure out HOW (electronic analysis/understanding of the brainwaves might be enough?)) can be recorded and used by a computer in some way. that is to say, the data can be digitized and therefore automated (what it is automated to do is up to the free will of the programmer).
human action recording devices (i bet the .com is open fml!) have to be a human right otherwise we can never truly own our data. if we cannot build the machine ourselves from scratch then we do not understand it and therefore do not own it. ok now i'm just skipping from definition to definition idk wtf i'm on about, gl;hf lawyers
