I fucking love that I don't even have to try that hard to write anymore. My dreams alone just pour into my brain and they tend to be way the fuck too trippy NOT to write. My thoughts I do still have to put effort toward, but very little.

I can't wait till I have successfully patched my verbatim thought output to my mouth input (which also has an output). I call it "launch".
