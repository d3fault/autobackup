I think I've stumbled upon a (the?) core of the problem [to solving world hunger]:

It is illegal to create the scenario where a bill implementing robotic food harvesting would be likely to pass.

^It takes a little bit of explaining. First, democracy is powerful enough to implement robotic food harvesting. It's just a matter of writing it up and getting it to pass. OT'ish: There's no need to kill any politician who doesn't +1 it, simply vote in new politicians. So the problem becomes awareness and convincing of the general population. Light at the end of the tunnel? Maybe not. The general population is (had:are told what to thi-) (had:easily) pursuaded by the media. It's foolish to say that the media doesn't heavily influence which of our laws get passed and which don't. One might even argue that they have complete control over which get passed and which don't (however, I wouldn't (keep reading)). Since the large media corporations I'm referring to are typically publically traded (and the ones that aren't large aren't relevant), they have a legal responsibility to their stockholders to do what is most profitable (so they don't have complete control over which laws get passed and which don't, because they are obligated (with a stick (law) _AND_ a carrot (money)) to follow the logical path of "whatever is most profitable". Elaborating/putting-it-all-together: for them to even attempt to pursuade their audience to pass a "robotic food harvesting" bill would be a [legally punishable] betrayal of their stockholders.
