re: infinite wormhole tunnel with man in it
i am looking at it from a back-left perspective relative to both the person and tunnel (since where he is facing is where the tunnel goes) and the person i am looking at is myself and i know it is myself. was this a dream? how do i still even now have such vivid imagery of it?

btw i am dancing [mostly?] and then when i realize 'it' (i forget what lmfao but know i have it written down and that feels great to know) i am standing blank-facedly and with my arms out to the side. my legs aren't kicked out as far as that divinci painting but my arms are right about the same. my tunnel has a larger diameter by i'd say about 6 inches or maybe it was feet or maybe i have no fucking clue but yea my hands were not approaching the inner walls of the tunnel, despite being outwardly extended towards them

eventually i am supposed to start dancing again!

does that mean i'm just the motionless guy?
actually that's applying a dream and/or vision (can't remember which tbh) terribly to my life as a whole so fuck that nonsense

still, the locked up AI or me in the tunnel either or is (was*!) definitely supposed to start moving again. the angles of rotation of my limbs are the limit. my xyz coordinate does not factor into the reference view of my body [only, if technically achievable]. i am in a black void of space with nothing but a fucking gay looking tunnel with sparkles and bullshit. i mean not sparkles but like a fucking star or... like... shit what's that overused photoshop filter? god damn my subconscious is fucking lame.
