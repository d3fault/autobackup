Police are entirely worthless as far as crime is concerned (they fill out reports about crime, that's about it), but my favorite thing they do is enforce rooms. I don't have to lift a finger if I want someone out of my room/house/etc.


In doing so I am oppressing their freedom; this is an example of freedoms colliding.


Freedom only exists within the confines of your own home (or any other property that is yours). Outside and other peoples' property are not free. You can't even sit down outside in lots of places.
