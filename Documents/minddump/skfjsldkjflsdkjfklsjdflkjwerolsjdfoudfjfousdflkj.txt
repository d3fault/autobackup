Gorillaz - D-Sides some song toward the end (last?) says "You cannot stop the natural flow of thought". Yet that's exactly what copyright does... and even though I like Gorillaz... it's proprietary which means it does stop the natural flow of thought. I guess you can file this under an example of awareness not helping the situation, but in this case I'd guess that it's just because Gorillaz didn't know how sell out while still owning their shit (or even if they still owned it and it was still proprietary, they're too dumb to see the contradiction).
