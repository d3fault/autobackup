Tripping balls to the other side of the universe. You forget humanity, but logic comes with you. You need logic to process (or ATTEMPT to process ;-P) the trip. While there as nothing more than a 'this'-in-a-void, I code. A concept of 'this' and logic are all that I need to be content (I enjoy codan). The 5 senses flood my 'this' as I become sober, and I try like hell to remember what I just coded.
