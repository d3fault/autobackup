i liked the scene in the movie "blown away" where the bomber was in The Dude's house and the mom/girl came home and it showed the huuuuuuuuuuuge variety of ways that an electronic signal could trigger a bomb

it makes me feel like i should try to hide under the radar
it makes me feel like DISTRIBUTION (hiding with the crowd of randoms etc) is the only way to survive

i am a motherfucking paranoid, but actually after seeing that scene it reinforces my justification for being one. life is ridiculously difficult to protect

don't move
don't go outside
don't do anything
(even then you can still be approached/shot)



i don't know what the fuck i'm going to do... but that was an interesting scene...


and yes, i saw it as a 'message to me'

but now really i think i'm just being stupid-paranoid
i don't think i'm being ripped off (aside from what i say out loud)
if i was being ripped off, there would be so much more to rip off that yea i dunno
they'd be doing a shit job of ripping me off, let's just say that
