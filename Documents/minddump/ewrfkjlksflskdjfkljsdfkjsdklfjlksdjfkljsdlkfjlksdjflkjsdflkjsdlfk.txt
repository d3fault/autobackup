I said yesterday, "I can't look at myself because it's distracting" (aka: grabs my eyeball's attention). That is metaphor/analogy to the existence we live in. We perceive 5 senses and 4 dimensions, but that doesn't mean there isn't more. We can't conceptualize or quantify them because we've not experienced them [directly? in an understood way? idfk]. Our 5 senses and 4 dimensions reality/existence grabs our attention, and it's all we know so we think it's all there is (it might be all there is, wtf do I know?).


I don't think the world's problems (SOCIOPATHOCRACY being the most challenging imo) are unsolvable, I just think that neither I nor anyone else alive is smart enough to solve them. "Yet", obviously..... but whether it's 5 years or 5000 years from now for some person to reach the level of intelligence required, who knows....
