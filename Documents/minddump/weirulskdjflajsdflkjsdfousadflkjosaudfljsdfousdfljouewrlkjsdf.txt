kill domain == launch

I consider the two scenarios to have the same amount of risk:
a) I set up a domain and let anybody (anonymously (tor) or not) click a button on a website that is triggered to a gun that shoots me in the face
b) I launch as I am now planning to


I'm fucking stupid, but I refuse to cower and hide and wait (mb I should :-/). That would mean evil wins (imo). Infinite multiverse theory has to pull me through...
