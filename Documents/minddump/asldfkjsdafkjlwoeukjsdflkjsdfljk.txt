Do we not all stand on the shoulders of giants? Are we not all on the bleeding edge of evolution the moment we are born? To claim otherwise would be to claim to be born in a black room without input from the outside world (to be more accurate: in the jungle and/or desert with nobody around). Imagine yourself in Kindgergarten attempting to take the role of your teacher. Stupid. Derivative is god, else we all must reinvent the wheel of knowledge that preceeds us.
