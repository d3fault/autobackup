offline/devbox conversion to 'input only' complete
I added a DVD-Rom drive to it

before it was just 3x HDDs and i'd use a read/write usb thumb to move shit around




this is not sufficient, but is an improvement i guess????

good practice or something

meh

i need to output

already as we speak my keepass db is out of sync
offline version is newer
it's just YTMND, but the point remains valid



that whole multi-machine input-only/output-only (multiples thereof) combo design is still stewing in my subconscious
i might need to create my own OS
but actually I think what I really need is just an environment, WHICH I AM GOING TO MAKE ANYWAYS

so I can just do it all on Qt


but the whack ass design won't work with other parts of the operating system(s???) that aren't... integreated... with my environment

replay'able

or something

so confusing


but yea, this input-only machine mode is only a SLIGHT gain


it only means data is less likely to leak (until i plug in that usb and negate the effects lmfao...)




input can still corrupt my files permanently, regardless of encryption status. dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda|b|c == i am dead :(

that's why i need an output only box TOO

and they all need to harmoniously work together
my fucking brain hurts

i don't trust filesystem drivers


ACTUALLY
tbh

i do.

but in the long run: i don't and shouldn't


but right the fuck now
i am unknown

and my usb method is PROBABLY (famous last words) 'safe enough'



but considering THERE EXISTS a design where you don't have to!!!! i should use it.
even if i have to invent it.
fuck yea
