the trip told me to go 100% public so i should go 100% public?
"mission accomplished. reporting in for NEXT task plzkthx"

perhaps i NEED TO trip while on 100% public mode in order to decide (get assigned.. from my own brain) what to do NEXT
obviously tons of software
but yea i mean there are changes to my life that i will probably make
non-software changes (such as: BROADCAST LIVE 24/7/365 100% fearless mode (the idea came up in a trip lawl))


gah it's like i really really want to... i'm just afraid of being shot down and having my life cut short because of it....
do i need CONFIDENCE in infinity????
is that all i'm lacking????
my next doc, which contradicts this one, will elaborate on infinity~
