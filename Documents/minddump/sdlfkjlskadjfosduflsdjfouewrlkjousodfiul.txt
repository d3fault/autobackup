If you have an ultra secure machine and you carry it with you to ensure it's security, and it's in a sort of "output only" mode where you rewrite the partition/fs of a thumb drive (etc) before every time you write any files to it (to evade partition/fs vulns), but you don't keep the thumb drive to write to on your persons (even if you do, it's still a good idea to repartition the thumb drive because the data was likely "sucked up" from a corruptable online machine that could have sploited your partition/fs), the PHYSICAL DEVICE ITSELF could still be customly hacked to still exploit partition/fs vulns. The thumb drive can lie to the system and say "yea we just repartitioned/mkfs'd" and then when you go to actually write your data the device can re-activate JIT the partition/fs with the bug/exploit (hypothetically, a write bug that allows running arbitrary code (from there it's simple stego to get all the contents of the offline only machine) and fucking own your machine...
