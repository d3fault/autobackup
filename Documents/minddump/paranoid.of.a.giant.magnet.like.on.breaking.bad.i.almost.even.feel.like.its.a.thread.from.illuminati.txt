the first episode of season 5 of breaking bad has me scared
and makes me want to sync
as well as move to SSDs
both.

paranoia
but at least i'd have a backup a month or so back

i wouldn't have to become an hero

still, it's getting sync time again
especially with this rpc generator coming to fruition
i'd say sync as soon as rpc generator is at 0.1 alpha stage

it's your first product after all
god i hate fucking magnets

lulu print/sell/emp-proof-backups fuck yeeeeee
