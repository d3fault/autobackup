I think the fact that I can't see myself in a dream is significant and/or metaphorical (my subconscience deliberately won't allow it). In a dream I can only experience it from the first person. This is similar to life itself. EXISTENCE is my body, and (had:but) Steven is my first person view within that body. I am not able to comprehend/see existence as a whole; I am only able to experience it from the first person view. Just a blind guess but eh sounds good tbh...
