Right now "going outside" feels as unlikely as launch did before I launched. However I'm extremely confident I can make it feel like launch does now. It feels like it's drifting away. It is. Like a fish swimming away from my hand as I reach out of a (had:) boat. But I already have a massive (1 mile across) net dropped. You're mine.
