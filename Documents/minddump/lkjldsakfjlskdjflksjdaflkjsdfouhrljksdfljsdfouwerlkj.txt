Being a human is fucking hilarious. What makes life enjoyable is the very same thing that makes it suck (ie, is the source of evil): pleasure. Feel and emotion and all that yada yada = great. Greed is a pleasure. Do some form of work just to survive (necessary) but overshoot it and find pleasure in amassing wealth. Typically it's their only source of pleasure (aside from obvious bullshit like sex and eating)...
