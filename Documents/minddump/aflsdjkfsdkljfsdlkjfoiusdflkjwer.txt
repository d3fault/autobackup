It happened! I barely noticed it.
My brains merged
Now, launching/planning and launching/coding are the same thing
I only have one thing I do (aside from eat/drink/sleep/masturbate/bike-ride/shit/piss/shower/music): code
I'm chipping away at RpcGenerator like no other. There is nothing else for me to do. There is nothing that has my attention. I'm still re-contemplating over and over my launch strategy, of course... but most of it is decided. Still a bit iffy on vulgarity vs. censorship but eh letting my subconscious handle it as there's lots of code left so plenty of time to think about it. But I haven't really thought of any "new things I need to think about" lately. Stuck on vulgarity and just coding my ass off :-). So fucking pumped for launch but tbh it's becoming more "real" in my mind and I can't really see myself as like a "talk show host". Yea, my "show" is going to be different... but at the end of the day it's me on a fucking video stream. BASICALLY a "show". The fame and potential shame doesn't make me look forward to it. The lack of paranoia, the practically-guaranteed money, and the ability to FUCKING START on tons of programming projects (go outside!)... makes me ridiculously pumped. It outweighs the "shy" / "shameful" / "embarrassed" factor tenfold.
