Coding can be either time consuming or time saving. Which polar opposite it is for you dicates your skill level at it.


I suppose it's possible for it to be neither time consuming nor time saving (the time you spend is accounted for EXACTLY by the time you save), but that'd be extremely rare/difficult to target to hit... especially considering code has forward value. Ex: Maybe it took a year to code, and so right after you finish coding it it's been nothing but time consuming... but maybe from that point on for the rest of your life you save "100 days a year" (yes, in time) or some similar figure and it makes up for it.
