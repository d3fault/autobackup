re: "you only live once" is APPARENTLY true (though [probably] factually false), and "what seems real, is real"

The fact that "yolo" seems real/true is the primary difficulty in having confidence in infinite multiverse theory.

Infinite multiverse theory never claims that you retain memory from once instance of life to the next (if that were true, you'd be able to see infinitely far into the past). You DO die, and that's why "yolo" seems to be true.

__yolo__  __yolo__  __yolo__  __yolo__
__yolo__  __yolo__  __yolo__  __yolo__
__yolo__  __yolo__  __yolo__  __yolo__

From each of the yolo's perspective, they did in fact live only once. But from our perspective, there were 12 occurances.
