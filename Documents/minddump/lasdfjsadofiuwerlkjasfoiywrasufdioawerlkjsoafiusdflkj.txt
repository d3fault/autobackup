downright retarded
if Nokia (or whoever buys out Nokia ad infinium) ceases to develop and release Qt, they could change one small feature, do one small bugfix, per year, without triggering the BSD clause.

Nokia is being killed. Microsoft has them pinned down and have a string around their neck. In Nokia's coat pocket is a Glock (because of it's superior yet simplistic engineering). Too bad ballmer is sitting on your arms. Nokia purchased said glock with intentions of upgrading it's functionality in hopes that it could hold it's own on a day like this.
