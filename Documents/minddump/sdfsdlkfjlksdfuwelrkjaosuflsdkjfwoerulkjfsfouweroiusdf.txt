All I've done is theorized in my head about how I'm going to do testing from now on (NOT on devbox), and shit in a weird way i feel so much more comfortable writing code ALREADY!!! haven't even implemented my read-only-cd-rom-custom-debian-on-a-box-with-no-hdd-etc-plugged-in-and-then-crossover-cable-ssh'ing-it-from-devbox-to-that-live-boot-machine-for-testing (to be EXTRA fucking safe you could unplug the crossover cable after getting the source/binary but before testing, but this is probably overkill lol). like now i feel as though bugs are much more acceptable, whereas before i felt paranoid as fuck about writing a bug because it potentially meant my devbox would crash and all my data would be corrupt. LOL god damn i am a paranoid motherfucker but tbh that really is a possibility. c/c++ does not have safety mechanisms (nor do i trust virtualization all the way (you can break out of your chroot jail/virtualization -- at the very least it is possible)) to do the testing on the devbox
