An intelligent species at some point asks itself (had:himself ;-P) what they must say in order to let the aliens know they are ready to be contacted. The intelligent species determines that it must be some proof of intelligence. I have been wondering this myself for a while and believe the answer is: 'asking yourself what must be said in order to let aliens know you are ready to be contacted' is proof of your intelligence (and therefore sufficient (ARGUABLY, but honestly I'll admit that possibly not (derp 'make exception for me plx' ;-P))).
