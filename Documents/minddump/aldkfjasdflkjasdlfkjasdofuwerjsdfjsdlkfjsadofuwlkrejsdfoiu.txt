Now I feel even worse and don't want to go
but I also don't want to stay
cognitive dissonance much?

I don't know what it is
I guess it's this looming fear of imminent death
All my potential: POOF
Not that I'd miss it...
I'd be dead.


But shit, this is so fucking annoying
day in, day out: headache. noise. yelling. insanity. my 3 whole fucking websites (facebook, qt, ...). ok make that two. haven't checked xkcd/qc all week, don't give a fuck. icefilms every once in a while, but I know when to check it. Tonight for example: dexter, boardwalk, walking dead. Nothing during the week. No movies that I know of. Batman is december.

So disconnected
I love it.

So disconnected
I hate it.


If I'm going to disconnect, I need to go all the way.
I'm in some middle grey area that's getting fucking annoying.

SILENT because I have to be
SILENT because I want to be


Making random noise here and there on facebook...

...I'm a lonely depressed fucker.


I think this trip will help...
...unless I got died.


I know what I'm doing
I just am not there yet
I need a breathe of air for this next stretch
Hopefully it's the last and I can breathe freely soon
I feel sick
I feel insane
I feel weight

I'm trying to cope the best I can. Shit gets to you after a while, don't care who you are...
Fuck this house.
Fuck this version of hell.
Fuck this reality.

I am enabling a temporary reality with this trip. To regain and lose my sanity.
I've got a headache
