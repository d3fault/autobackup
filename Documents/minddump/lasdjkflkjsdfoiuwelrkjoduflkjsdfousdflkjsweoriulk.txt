On Paper I Suck At Coding
(regarding university degrees and bullshit)

opisac could be an alias that is JUST SUBTLE ENOUGH to lead back to me, while still never leading back to me for the entire duration of my pre-frozing life (people are just too stupid rite nao). This of course being if I decide to reverse my idea of launching... which I'm not even sure I have the power to do!!!! (I obviously have the power, but I'm not sure I could convince myself at this point)
