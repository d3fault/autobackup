If your only goal is money, then all you ever do is try to get people to owe you their time. You spend all your _TIME_ trying to get other people to owe you _TIME_.

Remembering that money = time (money is a placeholder for time) helps you put things in perspective. Lots of people spend all their time chasing other peoples' time... and at the end of their lives it's all they've done. Waste of a perfectly good life (wasted all their time).

Survival.
