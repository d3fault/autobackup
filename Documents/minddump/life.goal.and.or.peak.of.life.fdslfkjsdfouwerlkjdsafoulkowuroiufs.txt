the peak of my life will be a 5meo peak wherein i have the ability to play music well and ... a good amount of my software is functional. i will explain the meaning of life or something retarded and it will make sense to everyone and it will go well with the music i am playing and/or listening to. that's all i want from my life. such a low requirement, yet it feels so far away (especially the learning to play music well with fingers lmfao i am going to sound like shiiiiiit at first :-P)
