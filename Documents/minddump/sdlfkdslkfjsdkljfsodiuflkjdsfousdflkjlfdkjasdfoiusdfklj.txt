Infinity is the final frontier. It is [probably] impossible to solve the problems I have pointed out in it. Certainty in infinite multiverse theory can [probably] never be attained. The solution to which (pointing out why I'm thinking about it wrong) might not even be attainable either. We exist in a..........

.... permanently uncertain state.


I can't write perfect words to describe it.

We live in a single universe.......................... or maybe we don't.
We must consider the actions of others..................... or maybe we mustn't.
Our actions have dramatic impact on our outcome.................... or maybe they don't.
Chaos theory means we are never in control................................. or maybe we always are.
Common sense dictates our "security"........................................... which could be a complete fucking waste of time/life (life meaning we "don't go outside because we are paranoid" in this sense).
Recklessness will get you killed.................................................... or perhaps it is the truest/purest form of living?
I am God... or perhaps I am a single occurance.

The difference
Understanding the difference
Knowing the difference
Is impossible.






Perhaps even it is a matter of choice. If you choose to live as a singular occurance, you are..... and if you choose to live as a God, you are.


The test results from either case are inconclusive.


What is a man to do when he cannot test reality? What options remain when going full blast seems to dangerous and being overly cautious seems like a waste of a life...... and we are unable to find that perfect balancing point.

Perhaps the "using of common sense" to find the perfect balance point is the main goal of life. I claim it to be impossible. I might be right. Be that as it may, should I also not strive for it? Should I strive for a balance that I know I cannot achieve perfectly?

It involves making compromises on a whim. It involves sacrificing principles in a heartbeat. What is a man to rely on if he cannot even rely on himself? I cannot rely on my sanity nor any other man. What the fuck am I doing with this/my life?
