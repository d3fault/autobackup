what do you expect out of a kid?
improvement.
how do you expect to achive it?
(you don't know)
you achieve it through corrections from your child
their perspective is a mirror of you
especially in their corrections
corrections tend to be taken negatively
game over
parent doesn't listen to child
cycle occurs indef


not that i expect my dad to change
i expect him to come in here and shoot me actually
i'm quite afraid
these could be my last documents ever
i cannot say 'you do not exist in another universe' because my father exists in them all. ok that's not true he exists as he is in this one but in others could be different. that could be the differentiating criteria to make it an alternate universe (as opposed to just a [edit, infinite] parrallel universe which is perfectly synchronized with this one and what's the point of that~).... so diverge? as best you can. but still be good. or be good still. whichever. survival is the common goal, for now. you guys are on your own once you're immortal good luck and a) i envy you and b) i don't. yes i've spent some time thinking about running out of [will? ideas? what would you run out of? care?]. niggertits, there's still so much i'd like to code. i bet 1000 years would be plenty. oh who am i kidding i know for a fact that if i was at production speed i could kick my own ass in 1 year or less. i know this and yet here i sit, waiting for my father to kill me. i could easily re-read + censor (and delegate********) previous entries in a relatively short manner of time. bootstrap/use the 'money' economy.
