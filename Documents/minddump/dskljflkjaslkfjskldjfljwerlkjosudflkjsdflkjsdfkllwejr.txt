All drugs I've tried, except for frog venom, start you down on the ground and lift you up some. They build you up off the ground, layer after layer, and make you "high". Frog venom, on the other hand, takes you to the vector maximum near instantly (within... 10-30 seconds) and drops you. The rest of the trip is spent falling back down to reality (even though of course yes, it is reality the entire time). 'falling back down to sobriety' just doesn't have the same ring to it, and I want you to buy my book so I am talking like a faggot.

The first part of the trip is the scariest, no doubt. I've learned to enjoy and crave it. For a few brief moments: clarity.

I would imagine DMT is the same, but I've still yet to try it :-P............................


I think there's something significant about what I've said. That frog venom starts at an opposite end. An opposite end of consciousness. Both ends are unquantifiable as of yet. Unnamed. I have no idea what I'm talking about because I'm just now figuring out what I'm talking about.

Still don't have a fancy word for it, probably never will.

Although I guess I can choose to. Right this very fucking moment. Hmmm.....





...for some reason "phlifa" keeps coming to mind, but that name is already taken....




For those you all serious like, sorry for being immature right there. Penis is penis.



Damnit, can't think of anything.... *tries more*...



grounded
opposite of grounded
and yet, "!grounded" isn't sufficient.
