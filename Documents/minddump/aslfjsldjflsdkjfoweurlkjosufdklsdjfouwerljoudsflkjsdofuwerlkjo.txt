I don't think I can not.
became: I don't think I will not.
became: I will.

"I don't think I can not" = I don't think I can resist my emotional impulse to launch. Seeing as life is only valued because of emotion, I need to surf (had:ride, but intended to write surf before even starting writing this doc) my emotion. Not launching is suprpressing.

Despite the above that I thought of last night (sans the surf shit, which compelled me to actually write it), I'm back in "IDFK" land and am not decided.

Continuing fancy writing: the word "surf" is appropriate because it demonstrates the sheer power of my emotion over me. My emotion is the entire ocean and the wave that thrusts me forward... whereas I am just a man on a surfboard. Several orders of magnitude difference in...... "size" (power? control? ability?). My emotion owns me and I want to submit to it (I am ok with this, considering my emotion IS me).
