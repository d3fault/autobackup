Free Software vs. Proprietary

I am reminded of being in my pre-calc class in 12th grade

my math teacher was making a point
that none of the other students seemed to grasp

I can't remember the exact equations

but they were something like


50^2
vs.
.000001^3

which will end up being higher approaching infinity?

I raised my hand (abnormal) and gave a perfect description that the teacher loved
something along the lines of:
"The number with the higher exponent will ALWAYS be higher than the lesser exponent when approaching infinity"


yada yada

do you see the parrallel with free software? keep reading if not

Propriety software will have tons of money thrown at it so it might be better at first
but in the long term, free software ALWAYS surpasses proprietary

even if it's 20 generations from now
it will happen

proprietary software dies on a storage medium
free software lives on in derivatives indefinitely
