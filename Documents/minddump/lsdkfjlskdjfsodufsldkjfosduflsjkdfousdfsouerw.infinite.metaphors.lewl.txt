The universe is a giant event loop. I am a callback activated by time (which churns said event loop), and when I die control is returned back to the event loop. The callback is asynchronous in that many of said callbacks can be simultaneously active, but synchronous in that only me/this-callback can control this specific set of molecules (mah bod) (technically not necessary, but that's how it currently is (w2b conjoined twins)).
