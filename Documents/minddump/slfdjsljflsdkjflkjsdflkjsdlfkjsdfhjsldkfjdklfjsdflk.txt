If I die soon I may very well be sad [during my last/dying drug trip], but at least I'll know I tried. I can't say that'd be true for any alternate life I could have lived (not even the one where I loved GIRL [and she loved me back]).

Aim infinite sniper rifles in the general direction (had:area) of the target and at least one bullet is guaranteed to hit.
