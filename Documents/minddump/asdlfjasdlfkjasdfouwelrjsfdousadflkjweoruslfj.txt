I feel I have, in the passed week or two, formed a metaphorical fist. I am much more committed, much more confident, much more... prioritized (fuck perfection). I am ready to take on the world. I am wasting time sitting around. I have made a lot of progress even though I have written very little code.



re: fist

It was not a hand
There is no body

err, there *was no body.



There is now, ONLY, a fist.

I am a fist floating in black space
