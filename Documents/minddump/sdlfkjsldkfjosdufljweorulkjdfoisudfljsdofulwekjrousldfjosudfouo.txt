Love is the gravity that pulls me forward. Guilt from Caydon and Lexi merely speed me up. Even if I can't have her love in return, she has mine and that's the only requirement for the gravity to take effect. That or I can/will delude myself into thinking I can win her love. Fuck it. Doesn't matter (though it VERY much does (without love, life is worthless/pointless/stupid/boring/etc)).
