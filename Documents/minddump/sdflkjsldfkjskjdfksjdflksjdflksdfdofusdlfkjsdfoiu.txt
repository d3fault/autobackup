It's ok to like money because money is just a placeholder for time, and wanting more time is essentially just wanting more life. Money becomes problematic ("bad", "evil", etc) when people spend their whole lives (time) chasing it, as is the case for just about everyone alive today. It starts off as a need (eat or die) but I suppose easily transitions into a a simple want and addiction (assuming you're good at it). People could live much more fulfilling lives if they saw money as time ONLY and considered themselves "retired" when they have enough to survive. If you don't have to work and you have enough to survive, you have all your free time available to you (and are the richest person in the world because of it). That's my goal, $500/mo passive.

Also, the above assumes you don't have expensive hobbies. I don't :).
