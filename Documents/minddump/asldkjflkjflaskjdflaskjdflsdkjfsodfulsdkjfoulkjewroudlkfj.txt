I would describe my writing style as "sensationalist", which is coincidentally similar to the word I used as a child to describe the orgasm/masturbation. I was 10-12 (idk) and I remember that I couldn't even cum yet (nothing came out). "This is a sensation", were my thoughts as I lay on the bathroom floor with a plastic baggy (un-needed, but now was I to know?) to my side.

Back to the point: I wouldn't read my own writing, I'd likely annoy myself. I get too into it, too descriptive. As I'm writing I am in my own conscience and can see the tangent ideas clearly and pick and choose where to drive the idea next, but to see it from a 3rd person point of view (even when it's myself) is not the same experience (usually). Yes I write about how tangents help you pick up where you left off etc etc... but it takes tremendous brain power and analysis to get back to that same state of mind. It is impossible to do perfectly... it is difficult to do reasonably. Most likely you just get a completely different experience while reading it (annoyed). I am too in depth. I touch on too many tangents that I leave for my later self to elaborate on. I use too many nested parenthesis. I love it and refuse to change (I need something to keep me busy during my indefinent stay here -- to fight the boredom).
