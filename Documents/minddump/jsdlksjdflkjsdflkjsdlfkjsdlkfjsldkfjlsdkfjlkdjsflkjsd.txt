Computer programming satisfies the power/control freak in me, such that I have no desire to control/manipulate other humans around me. Most people are not computer programmers.


How do you convince a person who's successfully become "more powerful than most" from the act of greed... to not be greedy? The necessarily existing/minority group of "more powerful than most" are the ones driving our planet (whether they know it or not), and all they have planned is the aquisition of more power (usually in the form of money) for themselves.

I have not seen any conclusive evidence one way or another as to whether or not we are destroying our planet. Since it can't [yet] be proved that we aren't destroying it, our safest/smartest course of action (wrt 'security theory') is to assume that we are destroying it ("better safe than sorry"). Maybe we only have 100 years left (in which case we're fucked), but maybe we have a few hundred thousands years left (in which case maybe business as usual [for now] is actually fine). We're a young species and haven't the slightest idea how [much] long[er] earth will be able to sustain life.
