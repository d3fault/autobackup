Climbing an arbitrary mountain. Doesn't exist until someone starts climbing it. If you climb a frequented mountain, the easiest way to the top can be identified by a well traveled path (and probably signs). Climbing/creating your own can be difficult (proper design can help, but only so much), and you'll often find yourself on cliffhangers that double back down before going up again (not the easiest path available).
