Individual employees at a software company (*cough* I wonder which he's `not` referring to *cough*) might be passionate about and enjoy the creation of software like myself, but if the company is publically traded, they aren't legally allowed to pursue that passion. They are legally required to be passionate about profits.... and only profits. The software must bend to profit. All software in a publicly traded company has the 'requirement' (industry jargon) of being profitable (had:right smack dab) at the top of the sorted-by-importance-descending list of requirements.

There was a similar doc I wrote a while ago about ethics. A business must (legally) choose the more profitable, rather than the more ethical, course of action.
