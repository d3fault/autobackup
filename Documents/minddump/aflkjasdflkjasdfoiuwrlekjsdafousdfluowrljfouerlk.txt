Eben and crew are right
nobody understands the fundamental logic
they don't understand that it's just electricity and magnets (well, SSDs are (thankfully) changing that) routed logically
there is no magic to it
it's just hundreds of thousands of engineering man hours poured into a single product
that explains the problem
the barrier to entry for understanding it keeps beign raised
even a simple computer (which i made on a circuit simulator back at ASU) is quite complex...

as is the barrier to entry for being smart in general...


idk
people just see em as facebook machines (did i steal that line? pretty sure yes)
waste of technology imo
