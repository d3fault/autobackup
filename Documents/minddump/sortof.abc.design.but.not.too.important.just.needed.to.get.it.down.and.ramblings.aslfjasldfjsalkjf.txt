so i finally got it
it finally clicked
the network protocol should only be known by:
clientshelper (in the server app) and bankserverhelper (in the appdb app)

it is disgusting to even consider letting the applogic interface with the protocol like that

what the fuck were you thinking?
oh right, you weren't


technically, clienshelper is part of the server code
as in, it is re-used anywhere that the server can be re-used

it has a basic interface: requestaddfundskey, createbankaccount, balancetransfer, payout, and the two broadcasts: pendingbalancereceived and confirmedbalancereceived

i mean that's it
the protocol is abstracted, and those interface methods (including their responses [well not for broadcasts, that's n/a]... since they are ASYNC) expose the parameters as they are: const QString &username, const QString &bitcoinAddress..... ETC
or the slot (request)
in the emit (response)

that's the interface
in a nutshell

you're deeping to dively to find (lol spooner) a solution to encompass all
each request/response (action) requires it's own logic

so you're going to need to code said logic no matter what

hard code this shit
get it up and running idiot
it isn't that complicated
you're overcomplicating it
probably because you aren't designing it first....



just do it
nike


it should be noted that not even the bank code would be aware of the protocol
appclients has it's own interface that the bank subscribes to
naw mean?

yea i naw u mean
k


now doit


or actually


i know this is a weird spot

but ima sync

got both tb hdds here

and refuse to leave my house unless it's to drop it back off at becher's


seriously
was planning on applying to mesa public schools maybe today (gonna be tomorrow i bet)
but am too paranoid to even go turn in an application until i have this sync done and the offsite copy back in place

1 offsite is shit
but it's better than 0

and too broke to do more atm...


god i _NEEEEED_ d3fault.
