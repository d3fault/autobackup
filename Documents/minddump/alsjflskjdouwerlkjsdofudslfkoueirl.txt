i feel like the world is eating me alive
that's what i feels like
i barely browse any fucking sites but whenever i do take in even a burst of input, i feel like i am seeing signs of being ripped off left and right
i think it's related to my recent committment to go full blast
"they" (those who have hacked me) have now moved onto "jack as much as possible because we can't do it anymore once he launches"
i seriously see an incredibly high amount
i don't mind that it's there
i mean... i DO

obviously


but i mind MUCH MUCH MORE when i see it for myself
it increases my paranoia level and just makes me fucking antsy, to say the least
it also modifies my output
i need to cut off input entirely
i am getting closer and closer (haven't facebook'd or /b/'d in quite a while now)

recently i only browse raspberrypi.org, qt-interest, qt-development, qt-project.org, planet.qt-project.org, xkcd.com, questionablecontent.com

AND THAT'S FUCKING IT
i stare at my screen of my online computer for most other interactions
i am getting quite... sucked into... or "good at"... doing shit on my offline machine. whether it's just writing docs or writing code (been THINKING about it a lot lately, semi-stuck but i know there's a solution (rpc service id))
