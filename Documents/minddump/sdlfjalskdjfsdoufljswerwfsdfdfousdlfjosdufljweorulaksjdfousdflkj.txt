Jail sucked because I knew I couldn't leave at will... but also didn't suck THAT much because I'm quite used to sitting indoors for huuuuuuuuuuuuuuge quantities of time. I was walking about this morning during the sunrise and I just like froze and looked at all the bushes and trees and birds and shit and realized that. Meh, I need/want to get the fuck outside more often. I need to launch so I can code fingers/led/mobilization so I can go enjoy mother nature more. Chaos is so beautiful and my room, mind, and computer... are not like the outdoors.
