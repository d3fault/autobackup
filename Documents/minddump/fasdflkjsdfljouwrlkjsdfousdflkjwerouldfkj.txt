i just watched "red lights" a few hours ago and i must say... what a shitty movie. it had potential but completely fucking lost it and spun out of control. ending was nail in the coffin. HURRR HE IS TEH PSYCHIC.


still, i feel like a lot of the lines in the movie are direct ripoffs from me. i feel like they put a psychic/fictional twist on it just to help them get away with it. oh well fuck it. i need to launch (like an rocket shipZ) asep
