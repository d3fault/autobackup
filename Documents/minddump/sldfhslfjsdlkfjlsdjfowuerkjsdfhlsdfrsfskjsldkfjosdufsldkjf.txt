Perspective.
Life (yours or anyones, but usually yours > everyone-elses ofc), from the singular first person point of view, is more valuable than anything else in existence. Without quantifying any further, it is "extremely valuable"
Life, when considering infinite multiverse theory and it's [logical] perspective, is valued at "approaching zer0" because of the infinite quantity of lives (yours or anyones)


We are meshy arbitrary and instantly replaceable beings, but my nuke dream last night put emphasis on something I've known all along: my (or anyone else's) actions can royally fuck up this existence... and I might have to live in it (well, there's always suicide ;-P). Living on a post-nuke landscape would suck (I just watched that movie with Gregory Peck and nukes and submarines within the past month. Was eery and I was surprised it had a sad ending (most movies don't))
