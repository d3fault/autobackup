I'm now considering an all LCB_ADD rewrite (where each add is a mutation and there's a corresponding "cache index" that's simply set but not relied upon), since LCB_ADD doesn't behave retardedly during a durability_poll (but there's still the problem of the key being available for 'get'-ing before the durability poll finishes (so confus on if/how it is a problem))... BUT then I'm wondering what the fuck I'm supposed to do during a durability fail anyways? What are it's possible error responses? Do they warrant failover? Do they trigger auto-failover? How do I re-trigger the just-failed replicate? Clearly it isn't re-LCB_ADD'ing, as that would fail (maybe re-LCB_SET'ing over that LCB_ADD (if you aren't the one who wrote it, read it first just to be safe)). If I don't answer these, durability polling does me no good [even if it worked with CAS-swapping]. I guess I intended to but just hadn't gotten around to it yet.

Should I just not give a fuck?
