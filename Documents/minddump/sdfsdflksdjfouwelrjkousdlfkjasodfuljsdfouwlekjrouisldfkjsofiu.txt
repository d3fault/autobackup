Rpc Generator Client Spec: I feel like a man running a timed marathon with nobody else running it [simultaneously]. I'm close to the finish and sweaty and delerious because of how tired I am. Yet, I still have the energy to keep going and finish. I have absofuckinglutely no clue how good of a time I'm making because I've completely lost track of time because of my state of mind being out of whack from being so damn exhausted from running so damn long. The only thing my mind and body know is: "forward".

I can see the finish line. Seems far because of how exhausted (confused in code sense) I am, yet I know it's not that large of a distance if I weren't so damn tired.
