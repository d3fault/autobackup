Something snapped in me. I guess it's just that I'm linearly approaching suicide and well yea, as usual I fall back to "well then WHY THE FUCK NOT [launch]?". This time seemed more real (I say this every time). Launch at home imminent hopefully. I ordered a throat mic to deal with the fact that my dad listens to copyrighted material REALLY FUCKING LOUD. I can still use a regular mic whenever he's not home or asleep etc. I've just all the sudden started not giving a shit about my sexual retardation as well. I'm going to have to face everyone eventually anyways, so it might as well be right off the bat. I'm going to calmly ask to be left alone. Dad's of course going to try to start arguments and he might even kill me (will make some good footage). I must not get caught up in his drama (his entire life revolves around his drama). I must focus on my own things: code, music, etc. Next doc about blackness will elaborate some.
