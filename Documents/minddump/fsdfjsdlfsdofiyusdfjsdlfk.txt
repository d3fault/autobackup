i can become/build mecha/softwareza and live in soundproof shit.
after successfully doing so, i learn/upgrade/optimize as much as i can the courses to beecoming a doctor. if i become a doctor as a side effect, so be it. if i can't/don't become adoctor. oh well as well. i want to appeal to that market (sounds weird but is true) because in 'reality' (this thing i am in right now typing this ) THEY <- (lolJ) will be literally saving my life. i could have a group of trusted doctor freinds. lol, trust.
fuck te h police
