life is pain
that's not to say life can't also be great
...but you get the bad along with the good
every waking moment, whether enjoyable or not, is life
for some, life is great
for others, it sucks.
each direction is still a feeling that you are only capable of while alive
death is neither
enjoy life, enjoy pain... strive for greatness
