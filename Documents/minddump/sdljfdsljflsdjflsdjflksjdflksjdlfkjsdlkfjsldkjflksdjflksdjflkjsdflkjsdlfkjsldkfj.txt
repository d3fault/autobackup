Sex is the source of life, and life is a beautiful thing. Yet we're ashamed of sex. Is shame just a made-up/artificial coping strategy? Coping with the (usually denied) fact that our lives bear no [natural] meaning beyond "penis in vagina"?

Shame and embarrassment are hard to really understand. You understand seeing someone else in it, and you know what it's like to feel it, but understanding the SOURCE of it in either case? We only understand it in the relative sense: we know what it feels like when it happens to us. But I mean excluding of course my above attempt at understanding it, which may or may not be true.

A simple coping mechanism, "hurr durr our lives are practically meaningless", amplified by peer-pressure/social-norms of course. Our lives don't have to be meaningless, but it's more accurate (and therefore enjoyable for truth seekers) if we understand that any meaning beyond "penis in vagina" is artificial. Fuck it, artificial flavor is still flavor.
