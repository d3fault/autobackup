i wonder if the last episode of House i watched last night snuck into my subconscious and is what finally got me to ask Kaylee. it's possible, but i certainly wasn't thinking about House at all [directly] even within hours after the show ended. at least i don't think i was ;-)

basically just a 'thing i want to do before i die'... that's pretty much it
it was, and not it isn't
fuck yea progress
/me codes furiously

i know exactly what do do now.
