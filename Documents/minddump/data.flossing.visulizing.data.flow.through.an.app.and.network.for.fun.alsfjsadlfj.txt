data flossing
pretty sure i already coined that term for a method of ensuring freenet content doesn't get lost


but here's another

sitting in your chair right at launch staring at the webcam, not moving
envisioning the path of bytes as they flow through the network
i mean... i did this unintentionally, and then realized what i did and thought it was cool, hence this article
only a coder can do it



raw video -> encode -> encrypt -> compress(mb before encrypt?dgaf) -> transmit (visualize this in your brain on an electrical basis, such as serial transimission) -> receive -> decompress -> decode -> draw pixels on monitor

shit's fun
half of it is performed once on my end
the other half is performed infinite times based on viewer count

so i'm sitting there at launch after saying nothing and vizualizing myself as each person around the globe
what do they want me to say?

who cares
honestly if you want to stare at the camera for a bit 'data floss' it for fun (while 5meo'ing etc, perhaps 'freak out' and tape your mouth closed), go for it
but it's important that you CODE
do not just sit
do not just talk
CODE

and btw, you are a free software junky and will only mention/endorse free software
sorry pi
'i have an arduino hooked up to a lightweight linux pc that costs $25' ;-P
