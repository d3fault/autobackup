5meo: life *MIGHT* be a metaphor for my entire existence, but i choose to think it isn't
i am really here and i really do have free will
consider the possibility that everything might be a metaphor/made up, acknowledge it's potential, and then quickly forget it
this is real, whatever it is

my life, from birth to death, metaphorically represents the entire existence of everything
because from my perspective********, they are one in the same
are other perspectives real?
i mean..
...i CAN'T know
but i think yes

agnostic theist
except nothing to do with god
i am agnostic as to whether or not other perspectives exist
but i choose to believe they do
act accordingly, noob
