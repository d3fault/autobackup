I can taste my lucid dreams, and they taste delicious. Like crackers/bread (think: LOTR.. those ones wrapped in leaves). The taste stays even after I wake up.


Maybe the electric moon thing was my subconscience saying hi, showing it/him-self. Of course I would think it's "me", because my subconscience IS me. Maybe my subconscience knows what itself is all the while (or, earlier on) while evolving and doesn't 'tell us' (say hi) until later and we can handle it (or more appropriately, figure it out)? I know it was me and I know my subconscience is me... but why don't I have 'control' over it? Not that I even absolutely want it: the imagery it/he paints is fucking amazing. I just am curious as to the differentiation between my forelobe/conscience and teh other stuff (subconscience). Obviously both of "us" (if you even want to say we are separate entities, idfk!?!?) are "electricity", so that electricity in the moon could count either way or both (but not neither xD).
