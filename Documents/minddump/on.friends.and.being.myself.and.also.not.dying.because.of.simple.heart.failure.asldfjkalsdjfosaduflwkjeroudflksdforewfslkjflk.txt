i would attach a heart rate monitor to my stream. if my heart stops, BY ALL MEANS: BREAK DOWN MY DOOR AND FUCKING SAVE ME.

i guess i shouldn't be TOOO far away from society
i just don't want to deal with noise complaints.
can't sound proof walls solve that?

cognitive dissonance:
wanting to be left alone
vs.
wanting to benefit from modern medicine (regardless of your [current lack of] a doctorate, you cannot SAVE YOURSELF if you are unconscious)



heart racing is fine, leave me be
heart stops, BUST DOWN THE FUCKING DOOR
etc


i need friends
doctor friends

but i also need privacy



you know, maybe that's just temporary anyways~
maybe after i launch i'll rid myself of shame (aka embarrassment) and will find (or just use old ones (nick, jeff, roxann, hannah, kelsey, i'm looking at you. accepting. feel like i'm forgetting one, but possibly many (edit: i was forgetting one: roxann. added. somehow typing jeff made me forget her. my brain can only hold 4 items at once)) lol) err forget what comes here. i guess find the strength/courage to... be myself... when others are around

guh fuck those names i don't like playing favorites... and the females of that group are a lot less questionable on the accepting matter
