Connection skeet shoot. Lasers or actual shotguns. Me and Gerard shoot fucking connections as they are established and the Rpc Generator (specifically, the MultiServerAbstraction + MultiServerClientAbstraction ... the fact that it's a "smart client" and can use many non-persistent connections and still stay in sync etc). I mean I at first visualized it just as an test app connected to a random number where connections are randomly brought up and down.... but might as well make a game out of it because life is fucking arbitrary. Real shotguns would get expensive, but laser-the-connections would be cheap and you could play it more than once.
