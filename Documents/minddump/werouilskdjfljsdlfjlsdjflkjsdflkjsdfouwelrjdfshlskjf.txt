All of life is organizing ones and zeros, too. But we do it at such a high level (in addition to the fact that we are a young species lacking the tools to see the individual ones and zeros) that we're only able to comprehend the interfaces to the various functions our bodies can perform.

Example/maybe-OT: you could take your central nervous system (the electricity conducting meshy shitfucks (industry jargon)) and build a computer that would perform math several orders of magnitude faster than your brain (which is only indirectly (err, directly but your CONSCIENCE is connected indirectly i guess(??)) connected to those same electricity conducting meshy shitfucks). You could probably use brain cells as registers too xD. Man that would be a neat experiment [to do with an already dead human body] for no reason whatsoever (except implulsive 'fun').
