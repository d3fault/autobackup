the first thing the the bootstrap should do before asking for a password is check the integrity of a) the read-only liveUSB installation, and b) the encrypted .rar/.7z (note: if i use an interface for this, i am future proofing for a future filesystem. i'm' not sure if d3fault would implement that interface though. i think it would involve public keys. hmm that's what i need to do, think up what filesystem interface i want d3fault to have. after that, i can think of ways to figure out each slot/signal). after you log in, you immediately check the archive from which you emerged. fuck. how2 have integrity number inside integrity checked archive. the writing of the integrity number inside the archive changes the archive's integrity, and an infinite loop is entered. fuck this shit ima think of that interface
