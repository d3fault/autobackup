mfw unix time repeats itself for leap seconds -_-. you fucking idiots took something simple and made it complicated. why is "pure number of seconds elapsed since x" so difficult to stick with? who gives a fuck if it becomes unsync'd with the rotation of the earth. ADJUST FOR LEAP SECONDS LATER, IN SOFTWARE, WHEN TRANSLATING TO A TIMEZONE (inb4 an epoch needs an originating timezone (this is true, but that doesn't mean it needs to follow the dumb retarded "leap second" rules that that timezone has)).

Fuckity fuck fuck all my assumptions were wrong, now my code is going to crash during a leap second (or a file overwritten/erased/forgotten-forever, etc).

one liner: "seconds elapsed since jan 1 midnight 1970"

then pages and pages below: "oh btw it repeats itself for leap seconds"


YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES, you broke the one liner.



I'm looking for a real epoch now... but I know of none without that flaw, and even if I find one it probably won't have widespread library support. I'll make my own if I have to (but again, no lib support -- I could add lib (heh) support, but it would be difficult to "un-code" the leap second/year/etc support... and even more difficult to calculate it manually (wat do? look up at the stars and perform math?)), the moment I exitted me mum's vagoo = 0


oh just read about the "TAI-based variant". good I'm glad to see I'm not the only non-retard alive. but still, lib support -_-
