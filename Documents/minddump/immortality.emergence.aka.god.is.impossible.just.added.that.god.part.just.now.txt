i submit that immortality is impossible because one loses his sense of time and all tangental thoughts are followed infinitely which means that no forward thinking actually happens
at least, nothing would emerge immortal
we might still be able to achieve it. (i hope. i'd rather be stuck in an infinite loop than dead. (famous last words? no, famous words repeated infinitely, or something. tried to make this into a joke and failed. fuck it. you have infinite time i'm sure you'll figure it out hahahahahahahahahahahahaa rofl i do value my time that i have left.))
