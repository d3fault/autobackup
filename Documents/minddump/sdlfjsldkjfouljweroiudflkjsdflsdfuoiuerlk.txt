Flaling about randomly and acting impulsively is a waste of time because you get nothing accomplished.
Staying "in the zone", working really hard, and "accomplishing things" is a waste of time because you don't get to live in the now and/or do what you want with your life.


Those two can probably be re-phrased and minimized to appear much better.
