The accidental emergence of natural selection from chaos is the first step towards life. Could be wrong but soundsgood2me.jpg . As for when the system that is performing the natural selection becomes "alive" is up for debate, but uninteresting to me (not that I wouldn't appreciate hearing the result, I'm just not interested in researching/thinking about it (thinking = researching, fuck yea tangent)). There are 3 data points on the timeline that are of interest and that occur in chronological order: (1) - Emergence of Natural Selection, (2) - Emergence of Life (I consider trees and dumb animals to be alive), (3) - Emergence of self awareness of a life form (I say "a" since there are plenty of other life forms that have split off and are still stupid).


KISS. This explaination kicks ass.
