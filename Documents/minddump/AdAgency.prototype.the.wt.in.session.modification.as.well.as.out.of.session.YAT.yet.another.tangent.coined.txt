you know, i guess the proper solution is to prototype
since i am unsure, i must become sure

it shouldn't be too hard to make a prototype that reads/modifies the db from within a WApplication session... as well as when a random number is generated (going by my old Server.Post prototype). the random number generator is of course simulating the ssl connection to the bank server
the random number generator should have a db associated. each number 0-10 should add a row, and if the row already exists just append how many times that random number has been generated)

fuck, YET ANOTHER TANGENT
YAT
lawl.
they are all in the name of progress
but sometimes lead you further away from it
