had an interesting thought while out on a night walk

i was thinking about all of the dht solutions
and i just want it fucking solved
it should be solved by using a library

this is what i was thinking
and then i started thinking about all the clusterfucks (best usage of word ever) of implementations


but that wasn't the thought either (though 'clusterfuck' came after it)

the thought is basically a simplification of the dht problem as a whole
and why it is difficult
i think knowing/understanding it might also help me find a simple solution, even if i have to make it~


anyways
i keep typing
but it isn't coming out
...

the goal of a dht is:
high throughput reads
and high throughput atomic writes


simple as that

but they are both hugely different problems
high throughput reads requires caching strategies be implemented
and high throughput atomic writes requires consistent distribution

this was my eureka moment (at least i hope)

AHAH!
i thought

'distribution' is the opposite of 'caching'


a cache is like a collective
sure you can have multiple caches distributed
but a single cache is a collective

and a distribution... what high throughput atomic writing needs... well... isn't

so to solve the writing you have to ruin the reading
and to solve the reading you have to ruin the writing

there is no optimal solution
and there are so many solutions
for many different use cases

because it is (perhaps) an impossible problem to solve [completely]


i still wonder/hope if i can solve it generically enough for the majority of my use cases


if(isSet(valueIWantToPurchase))
{
  purchase(valueIWantToPurchase);
  //atomic write/purchase success
}

^is a fail
because it reads from the cache and then writes atomically

it'd need to be:
if(checkIfNotSetAndThenPurchaseIfItIsnt(valueIwantToPurchase))
{
  //atomic write/purhase success
}


the pre-condition checking cannot use the cache
so care needs to be taken when coding
the coder (just me for now) needs to be aware of that~











perhaps couchbase is easier
fml idk my bff jill tbh


i'm fucking raging
at ZooKeeper

ZooKeeper is basically chubby
google's bullshit
fuck em
meh

isn't couchbase just all i want with everything already done?
how fo atomic write?
