even though couchbase is not meant for WAN

a d3fault/dht could use the first [few?] node[s] as the couchbase "client" in a sense

access into the network

the abstraction allows us to somehow forcibly bill (pay!?) each server for their bandwidth/cpu/resources


security risks aside, a bitcoin with cpu/bandwidth would be more secure because bandwidth is equally as hard to 'forge'

the bad guy network wouldn't just need to have more cpu power than the regular network
it would also need to have more bandwidth :-/

i guess a worm could do this...


all in all, i'll admit that it might not be possible to do securely (therefore funds have no value)

but functional (hackable)? definitely.


safety from law is more important than safety from hackers

so they can down the network and delete/overwrite files

great.

if we still have anonymity/relative-message-security, it's still a win
