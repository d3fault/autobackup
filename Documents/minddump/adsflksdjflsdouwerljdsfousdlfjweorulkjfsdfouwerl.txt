this is why i scare myself
this is why the future scares me; this is why i kinda want to live in the shadows (i could be targetted by it)



a system where you must 'report in' daily else a string of murders are initiated
preferably targetting politicians, but it could be as simple as a random number generated hooked up to a name database (this would also keep the software ignorant of who was up next, thus easier for it to hide (cryptography thwarts this anyhow))


i came up with it in a matter of self defense

i'm trying very hard to think of a way to NOT get thrown into prison for doing mass quantities of drugs
one way is to DEMAND that you aren't
this is how the idea stemmed

by OBVIOUSLY it can be used for infinite evil purposes


"yes i killed so and so. if you arrest me or otherwise detain me... more murders will occur"






and for the idiot reader, i'm talking about bitcoin and tor hidden services (the services being assassination at this point)


hundreds/thousands/etc of tiny servers (raspberry pi is new as of 2012, but they'll just keeeeeeep getting smaller) around the planet to initiate the assassination if there is no 'report in'


the reporting in could even be subtle and done completely transparent of 'viewer' knowledge (if i was in fake 100% mode for example)



the future is gonna be fucking crazy




all this being said, if politicians/etc are targetted and it is not used for evil purposes (drugs are NOT implicitly evil. fuck off)... i could justify it to myself morally. though i don't think i would do this because they would probably torture you until you divulge the passwords etc required to 'report in', then lock you up for life. actually this is a vital flaw in the entire design. wrench to the face > your 10000000-bit password. /xkcd
