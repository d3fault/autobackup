I am right this very moment writing (had:righting) about how funny I think it is that I am LifeShaping easytree.cpp, and LifeShaper itself is incorporating/using the file itself (or maybe just it's neighbors, whatever). Feels weird to be catching up to "now" after all this shit from years ago etc...
