Elephant's Dream

I am the typist (but also Emo and Proog)


Freaking loved that short. To me the machine is existence/life (was surprised the wikipedia plot description didn't mention that.... but maybe it's because that's too obvious?). Proog is Emo and they are both the machine and it's an infinite loop. The beginning of the short loops with the beginning (maybe he pushes himself out of his own way?). I love the scene where the steps arise out of nowhere.. and the dialog during. I am both proog and emo.... I prefer the in-between of them: understanding. Proog was having a blast dancing but was way to "into" it to see that what he was doing was.... err hard to explain what goes here. Emo asked him if he ever got tired of it and just casually walked along. Emo understands and is bored, proog was blinded by being "in it" (dancing) and didn't understand [that part]. I want to be a middle ground between them: understanding that my actions are just BLAH (same hard to explain) and yet still being "in it" enough to enjoy it. For me this is dancing frantically after peaking on....... "knowledge".

I am the typist in the telephone room typing onto himself. It seems entirely pointless.... and in fact it is.... but the typist himself can still refer to and recall what he has typed (assuming he isn't networked to the rest of the machine). That's valuable enough imo. During this "long life", I wish to be able to recall what I have said [and to collaborate with others]. Still, I am typing on myself and it is pointless because it cannot be shared (can be shared among human peers... but it cannot escape the "big collapse"... so can't be shared between big bang instances).

All the wiring frantically moving about was trial/error natural selection/etc.
