I really want to live on mars. Geographically distanced from earth makes it much safer. At least on the shorter term. And really you can trust the kind of people they'd (governments) would send to Mars. I fear the intelligent astronaut MUCH less than I fear the average idiot walking around the streets...


They'd get done with their astronaut work and come over to d3fault's pad for some partying...
...would get lonely, but who ever said I have to be alone? (initially I envisioned myself alone)
