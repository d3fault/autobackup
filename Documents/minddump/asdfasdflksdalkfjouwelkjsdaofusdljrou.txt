The balance is impossible.
It can only be determined IN THE NOW.
And even then, it's merely a guess.
An estimated guess.

Balancing input/output (persons (with respect to 'machines', there is no crossover!)), control/uncensored (sfw/vulgar ?), safety/recklessness, and probably many others I am failing to remember... can only be done 'in the now'. Which pretty much boils down to: do whatever the fuck you want. Act however you want. Act, if you want. I don't want to act... and I also don't want to pay the price for not acting. Can't have my cake and eat it too.

Notice how nowhere in there did I say "I want to act". I only don't want to pay the price for not acting. I acknwledge and recognize the price of not acting (assassination, loss of friends/family, etc)... and see acting as a sacrifice in order to not pay said prices.

Actors in "Hollywood" etc are attention whores. O LOOK AT ME ACT AND DO NOTHING ELSE IN PARTICULAR. I AM SO PRETTY/HANDSOME MY PARENTS MADE A GOOD MATCH YAY GENETICS I WON THE COSMIC JACKPOT THEREFORE GEEF MONEYS + ATTENTION








Weighing the costs. Gah. I can't do it. I try as I might (mite?), but can't find a good balancing point. Probably because there is none! I'm talking about with respect to censoring my past + future (+ current?) life. I might as well just not censor anything (and to date, I still haven't :-P (I need to get on that, a 10-20 year prison sentence for ceeeep doesn't sound fun at all))... because then no costs have to be weighed! I free up my mind to do other things. I guess. Gah. I just.... don't want to accept the costs :(. Booo fucking hoooo. Whhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh. K done crying, fuck it fuck everything.
