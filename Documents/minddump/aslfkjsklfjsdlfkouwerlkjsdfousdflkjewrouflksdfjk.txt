Dear Kaylee, would you still talk to me if I was a pervert? I already am a pervert, but I have rough plans to make pornography on the side in the future (software will still be my primary focus). This isn't an act of desparation (for sex or money), I just genuinely like porn and am pretty sure I'll become bored enough with life to do it. However, as you're already aware, I've got a bit of a crush on you (out of my control feels like) and would GLADLY sacrifice my pornography "career" if it was a requirement for maintaining communication with you.

CIRCLE ONE: Y / N

originally had "Just as cousins, nothing more" at the end but took it off because that's dumb.


maybe I should use my "expert writing" / "expert sociopathic manipulation" skills to say something like "I value our friendship" instead of the "I've got a crush on you" bit???






This is about modifying my WILL, not my thoughts. I can do with the former, not the latter. I reserve the right to fantacize/dream about killing and raping (though the "do no harm" rule should be applied in reality, dreams, and trips (BECAUSE it is sometimes hard to differentiate between the three (I _ALWAYS_ know when I'm merely "fantacizing" about something though... when sober etc... so you can think any thought you please)))
