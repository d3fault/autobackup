humanity is the only solution to ever achieving anything greater than 50% (and thus "feel"able) towards "perfect". It does not necessarily require the need to die [in the indefinite sense] but that cannot be avoided anyways and it does if you can only achieve it through dna enhancement (that isn't somehow backport-able).

does a perfect backportable human dna generation exist?
no.
