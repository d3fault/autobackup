we are images of liquidity
we are flaling quantum particles (that have managed to create/summon(?) consciousness)
we are finite
and then we are frozen into eternity
right no i have free will
right this fucking moment
i can change my future at a whim
but the perspective of my life will be determined by my actions
a person looking back will see me as a ...... static..... entity
i am dynamic while i am alive
i am static after i am dead


i can say or do or contradict or [ANYTHING] while alive
once dead, i am merely what i have done



i have done nothing



except an opposite memoir

that's what this is

it isn't important


it isn't "the meat"

it's valuable
but it isn't important


memoir comes after your "life"
this


this minddump... thing.....

my incenssant typing

my journal

my log
my timeline
whatever the fuck you call it
my docs
is the opposite of a memoir
it is the pre-life
and planning phase
documented
woot.

but also: fuck it

if you lose, it you can still DO

your brain is the most valuable asset to you
protect it

(does this mean go private/hiding?)
