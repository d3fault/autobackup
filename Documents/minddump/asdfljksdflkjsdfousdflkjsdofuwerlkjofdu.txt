I think it's cool that I am able to comprehend the big bang and I (the big bang) didn't have the ability to think when it happened, yet I am able to NOW verify it scientifically.


I am the big bang chaotically evolved into an organic and "emotional" self aware robot.

The difference between me and my computer is: I am organic/quantum and my machinery is much more complex (for now). Oh and my software (which has the emotion bug/vuln/FEATURE(?)) is also evolutionarily driven/created by "natural selection" and lately a moderate amount of free will (comes after (or around) self awareness), which definitely helps explain the concept of "insanity" (a stage I believe every human must pass through (and each human has the opportunity to make unique observations as they do)).
