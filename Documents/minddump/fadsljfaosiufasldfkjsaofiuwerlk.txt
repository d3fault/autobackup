"as we enter a state of everything being documented/recorded, we must also admit that all media consumed (as well as all social interactions) make up who we are. the random collection of shit we learn about is our own personal brainwash. they say you can never stop learning. that may be true, but your time alive on this planet is finite... so there is a limit on how much you can learn" -me
ok the second half of that quote got a little off the subject
it was me hypoethically telling the riaa/mpaa industries that i am going to continue to watch movies and listen to music "live".

if i got rich enough to launch a satellite, and i did so and allowed 100% anonymity/security from/through it
(shit wtf normal satellites don't care what you put through them... so long as the information is properly encrypted/verified, there is not a problem using existing satellites. EXCEPT total 100% blocked IP or something. still, open wifi will always be there... so wtf? dns block for your particular domain? that's possible)
