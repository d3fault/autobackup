Every time you commit suicide, you wake up in a hospital because someone found you on time or you "got lucky". You can't NOT get lucky because you have to be in order to not get lucky. Contradictions. So you wake up in the alternate universes where you do get lucky, because you can't wake up in the ones where you didn't.

So definitely don't use a shotgun to the face method, heh.
