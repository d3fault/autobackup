Human beings are never content because they are always looking for something DIFFERENT. They do not understand even the definition of "different", but it's a "I'll know it when I see it" type of thing.

Different, to me, means mathematically impossible. Something not possible within the laws of physics.

Why we search for it is beyond me, but it's an aching curiosity that will never be cured.

We must learn to accept that all things are normal (exception: all existence itself cannot [yet?] be explained). We must learn to dance and frolic in the realm of the possible.

Me, I'm going to hook up a PRNG (with enough precision that my puny human brain thinks it's a real RNG) to pleasure and pain. The most painful I want is that which will not kill me. I don't think you can die of pleasure, but if you can then that will be my maximum as well. A perfect sine wave sounds fun too... but I think it might get old quickly (or after a while). The PRNG will keep things fresh.

Sure there will be other factors such as my attempt to create all forms of art.... but this PRNG machine will somehow be an aside to my expression/output. Like perhaps injecting me with chemicals that bring the pain/pleasure... or even just robots that "punch"/"massage" me based on the current state of the PRNG. There are infinite possibilities and I will enjoy trying new ones.

There should also be a baseline neutral where no machinery is attached for a period of time. This is where we humans mostly live.

I am getting away from the point but oh well there's not really much more to say about it: accept that you will never find something truly "different" and be happy with the infinite variations of normal at your disposal. I know I will (and should I not, I can always forget (by means of resetting (by means of suicide))).
