I'm getting all emo and attached to my software, it isn't fun anymore. It's because I'm coding to survive, not for fun. SO CLOSE TO BLISS! Instead of thinking "oh what an interesting problem I'll have to passively ponder upon it", it becomes "FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUCK MUST SOLVE BEFORE I CAN GO THE FUCK OUTSIDE I HATE BEING IN MY ROOM IN THE DARK I LOVE TREEEEEEEEEES N SHIT". Fuck you, code. Fuck you. (Except once I'm retired and do it for fun/etc, then <3 code).
