I am sitting here and thinking so hard that I think [........]. Like, I think my brain will pop. Or, I think I'll oneshot my problem. I also feel like I'll sit here so long that my computer and all drives die simultaneously. I guess all 3 of those COULD happen, but calculating the probability of it/any happening is stupid hard. I can also change the probabilities, at least in the computer case, to minimize data loss. Maintaining data integrity is really only dependent on semi-enough scanning of system integrity and detection (could also cause it, but it's worth that risk definitely) and replacement of failed hardware... because all hardware fails.
