I am depressed nothingness. I am the bang before it bangs. I am spinning frantically/rapidly/infinitely awaiting that moment of brilliance (launch/bang). There is no guarantee that I'll do it. "It is by will alone I set my mind in motion" (Dune). There's inifinite experiences to be had AFTERWARDS, and also infinite nothing/depression if I don't make it happen.

My output could change others' lives drastically so that project 'X' emerges and that project alone could change my own life drastically (in unforseen ways). That project 'X' could also change me drastically so that project 'Y' emerges. So on and so forth infinitely.

I need to launch ASAP. I owe it to all my fellow humans and MOSTLY myself (because I am me and we are all self centered (can't not be (surrogates are as close as you can get))).
