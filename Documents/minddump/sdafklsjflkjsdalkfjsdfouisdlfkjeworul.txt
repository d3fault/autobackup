I have to take advantage of the free market (even a tiny bit) so as not to starve to death.

That is actually false (farmer), but shooting them (the funds) at DPL produ- (hmm that word doesn't fit. modules) is a good (justified) way to justify taking advantage of the free market. That, AND it depends on "arbitrary job creation" to sustain itself.
