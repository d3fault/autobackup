me pretending to speak to robby at his party that i changed my mind and went to (hypothetically in my brain):

"i'm glad i didn't go because i had a burst of productivity
but then ran out so decided to come"
yada yada

and then i announced in front of him + that random girl i want to fuck (idk, i just pictured an audience of sorts):
"and i decided i'm going to publish a book. i might as well since they're going to dig into my files after i die"


and then i kept thinking here (not in the hypothetical) about "might as well"

MIGHT AS WELL

artists die
then become famous

attack that business'ly


well i mean that's what they all do
except i'm doing it retroactively
(or i've just been lying to myself this whole time :-P)
