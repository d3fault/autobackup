some physicists will tell you that time does not exist without the universe
or that a tree falling in the woods with no-one to hear it doesn't make any sound

i disagree

i cannot (and refuse to think about because it will lead to insanity)

fuck lost my train of thought


but i mean

there is a reference point

a year '0'

PURELY used as reference

there is no beginning (that's what thinking about will cause insanity)

ok maybe there is
but we/i don't understand it
and possibly can't.

ANYWAYS
back to the point:

year 0, for reference only: universe "bangs"
year 9999999999999 (sameshit, reference): universe collapses

the next bang is not at year 0
it's something > 9999999999999

just because there is no universe around to perceive the time
does not mean time doesn't keep on ticking

this conflicts with lots of physicists theories
but i don't care

their shit just doesn't make sense
nor does us even being here

fuck it

so that's what i meant in my previous entry about 'NOW'

we're at 5839383 after some reference point 0

or maybe we're 563 sets of 9999999999999 from some 'beginning' that we can't even comprehend

but at any rate

i'm saying that we can only increase the number
measuring in years is stupid
because that's just a relative term to us earthlings

but you get the point

while(true)
{
  someUnitOfTime++;
}


always in the 'now'
but don't get this confused with that other shit about "there is only one time: now"

which is INTERESTING

except that i know what just happened 2 seconds ago and that i was in control of that moment
sure it might just be a figment of my imagination that the past even happened
but so might be all of existence

i prefer to operate under the assumed reality
what appears to be real, is

until proven otherwise

and proving otherwise might cause everything to break (ok i'm just rambling now. that makes no sense)
just like when a coder discovers a bug that's been there all along and it causes the whole application to stop functioning and nobody can figure out why it was working to begin with (it shouldn't have been). again, just rambling and making interesting thought at this point. it's PLAUSIBLE.. but i doubt it. assumed reality remember?
