harperactive told me via email that he'd release all his content under CC-BY
i actually saw him put a "All my music is available under..." on his site


but i just checked today and he changed it to CC-BY-SA-NC


too bad he can't retract his previous one


'sometimes fate reaches out' -inglorious basterds



this presents an excellent opportunity to test the waters of CC-BY-SA-NC
to see if streaming counts as NC
i'd say it does

stream + image advertisement above the stream, possibly embedded into it


it would have been better if he did CC-BY-NC i think

because my use of it would at the very least be violating the SA portion of it
since i plan on releasing my video under CC-BY-SA


BUT, it doesn't matter too much since he released it to me as CC-BY



i need to keep my mouth shut about it though
i could/might incriminate myself
for example i just today downloaded a handful of the albums

but i got a handful of them a while ago

technically only the ones i got a while ago are CC-BY'd

but if i plead the fifth and let my lawyer use the conversation between us, i should be alright


really though i think i would sit on the email shit until the NC has been tried
if it ever gets to that

which i doubt it will ( SA :( )

oh well fuck it fuck him, though his music's amazing


really, he might be ok with my use of it, idk

and hell, i'm mildly considering using NC myself
but no i like BY-SA the best
because it forces businesses to do BY-SA also
so content can still be made and it forces it to be BY-SA

like if fox showed it, their derivative based on my works is now BY-SA and i can reference/host it
not that i have any interest in that
