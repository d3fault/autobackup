I just thought of the perfect[ly hilarious] response to people trying to dominate me (in general):
"Are you trying to have sex with me?"
Them:
if(yes)
	I decide then and there if I want to have sex with them. If I decide I want to, I can say "I'll grab the rope" or some such. Otherwise, a simple "sorry not interested (optionally: "... at the moment")" will do.
else if(no)
	I say "Well sorry, I only like to be dominated in the bedroom".


Just like the movie Scarecrow, it would knock them offbalance (aka defuse the situation) and hopefully get them laughing, in addition to no longer attempting to dominate me.


OT/tangent: If they go into denial mode and say they weren't attempting to dominate me, it would be[come] extremely annoying to have to explain it to them. I can/should delegate that task of explaination to someone else who heard it all go down (Someone who knows how to confront without arousing anger -- a rare talent (but shit there are 7 billion of us, not that hard to find)).
