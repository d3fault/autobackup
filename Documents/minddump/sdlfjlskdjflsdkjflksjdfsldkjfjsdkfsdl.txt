i can write only about good things or i can write about the downers too. i can write only one of those only if i so choose. i have the power of presentation on my side. i can choose to act and hide. doing any variation of any of the above (1%-99% or 99%-1% (calculus'd)), i am not changing my person... only the appearance of it. it is a sliding window over a creature too large to fit through the window. 2d coords just sliding around like the screensaver, cept it's a glass hole. if i write without prejudice and/or categorization***, i can be myself. doing that in public (with people present) is difficult. they modify me. in every instance i know of, i cannot concentrate on programming and that one other person that's there's bullshit as well.
