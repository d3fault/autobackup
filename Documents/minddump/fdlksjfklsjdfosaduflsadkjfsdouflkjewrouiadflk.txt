(envisioned scenario)
RMS: Why would you do such a thing?
me: Because I'm an asshole and I have free will and can and will do anything I please.
RMS: That's going to catch up to you some day
me: (the entire reason for this doc) -- You're right it might, and I will be ready for it. I will only be disappointed in myself if I do not accept and understand what is going on as it happens (should denial take over (excluding me 'not seeing it coming'. That's something else entirely)).
