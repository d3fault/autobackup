Bravery, Dilemna

I am not brave, I simply come close enough to suicide to not give a shit enough to enable me to do things that require bravery.

In this world, the now, the who I am, the what I live in, I want to blow my fucking head off. I want to die. With what I will gain, with what there is to achieve. With what life is capable of. With the potential. With how great things can/WILL be, I want to live.
