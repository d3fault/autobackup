enough on my plate, fuck toe tappin. i am a coder with a fucking shit ton of ideas and designs and yada yada, i was considering the other day and really actually fantacizing too about using "Ian P. Fou" as an anon alias and controlling him/it via toe tapping (d3fault would broadcast 24/7/365 and hide in plain site). it does sound fun but i mean i have enough complications. coding is no walk in the park and my head is already torn in so many directions. i think it would help with direction and sanity to lessen the burden. the only downside is that i can't turn back time and do it later.... whereas the opposite isn't true: i could always stop toe tapping later. it sounds fun in a way, it would be something i could whisper into kaylee's ear (if i became infamous) and she might think it "awesome", but really it's a lot of work and then i'd be afraid of leaking and yada yada. it's just boring ass copyright infringement type stuff anyways. row row fight the powa. i think my higher tech ideas that DO NOT BREAK THE LAW (WOOO i am happy for that, fuck hiding) should be focused on instead. i am choosing not to participate in the tor anon wave. i am slightly envioius of those who are in it....... and it does make me wonder if the hackers on the anon side of things will see me and be jealous of me (my freedom/sanity/etc).
