I just after writing all these docs today got my Garage + Daft Punk - Da Funk idea

ACTUALLY they are copygay'd so should i use another? It was the original song I thought it would go with (shit i just "mentioned", lmfao), but I'll at least look at my small CC-BY collection for a substitute. Originally wanted to post on yt/fb, but will attract too much attention so just going to make it and keep it private for now :-D
