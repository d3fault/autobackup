at least one of the following is true:

1) illuminati exists
2) universal collective conscience exists (or at least worldly). it cannot be directly tapped into. it is accessed via your subconscience, of which you have no control (by definition)
3) i am a paranoid schizophrenic / insane



they are not mutually exclusive. all 3 might be true.
