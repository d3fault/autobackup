Money is the root of all evil? You've got the right idea... but haven't abstracted far enough. Food the root of all evil? Getting warmer. Chemical reaction is the root of all evil (and yes, of course the consumption of food is merely chemical reaction). Since raw chemical reaction is the starting point of evolution (primitive as fuck form of eating), it follows that we are evil.

But it makes you re-examine the definition of evil. I think 'intent' is a biggy. We didn't ask to evolve, all this energy simply fell into place and we (and the [shitty and almost always corrupt] system) are the product.

The whole thing can't be evil if the thing is also responsible for defining evil. The definition of evil is generally pointed outward xD.

But yea, senseless chemical cannibalism does reek of evil. However, that doesn't mean something good can't come from it. Love is eventually created from emotion, and love is definitely good. So good that it justifies the "evil" roots.


Maybe the system isn't fixable for everyone, but I know damn well I can: 
1) Create enough turnkey businesses to survive solely off passive income
2) Surround myself with (and emanate) love 100% of the time
3) Freeze myself until doctors can thaw me out in the future (where maybe the system isn't fixed, but the computers will be fun to use... and I can live in love indefinitely/semi-immortally (big collapse likely inescapable))

#3 might not succeed, but the freezing process already exists so eh it's worth a try
