This dirty hacking gives me a weird taste in my mouth. It's sort of satisfying but it also tastes like dirt. I think the reason is because I know I'm doing downright dirty hacking and that I care about the resulting code because it's mine. If this was for some employee or whatever I'd be cranking it out and knowing it's hacky, but I wouldn't give much of a shit. It's satisfying/fulfilling to know it's mine, but it makes me less "ok" about it being fucking dirty hacks n shit. The feeling of eating in general is only here because the resulting code is mine. If I was coding this for someone else I'd feel your usual empty/apathetic feeling (even if writing the code was a little bit fun). It's a new feeling, an "I own a fucking business" kind of feeling that not many ever feel. Fucking slaves.
