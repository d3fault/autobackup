My target audience is the whole world, but my target intelligence level is my own and similar. I won't speak down [much], and it doesn't make any sense at all (unless you sit in coffee shops reading books trying to look sophisticated) to try to speak "up" (not to be confused with voicing your opinion or speaking loudly (guh, clarifying (speaking down in doing so (now you're just confused (hello self))): doesn't make sense to speak to people smarter than you at a level of intelligence above your own, because you can't)).
