think I may have written this before: The moment of "the big collapse", the "big bang" happens again.

Err strike that (though it is sort of also true for the same reasoning (applies differently (there is not life forms at that point (nor does there have to be for an ENTIRE "bang" (if we don't emerge, we don't miss out or even know we missed out (lol wut)))))).


The moment the last lifeform dies off, a new one starts.


"If a tree falls in the woods, does anyone hear it?"


"If trillions/zillions/infinite years pass in between life emergences ("evolution"), does anyone experience it?" <--- NO. There that pretty much summarizes it. There is such a thing as notLife but only Life can experience time elapsing, so RELATIVE TO LIFE, there is only ever/always life.
