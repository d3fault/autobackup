theory (could be bullshit, but can't prove it isn't): I am always born as Steven because he was "born" during the early days of the internet and he always learns programming, defeats /b/, etc... and figures himself out. It's the best way I can let my brain understand itself. Everything is made up and a figment of my imagination (but still real in that sense). Everything plays a metaphorical role.


.... but since I can't perceive anything else, it IS real.
