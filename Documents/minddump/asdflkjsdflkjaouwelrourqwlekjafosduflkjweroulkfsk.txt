i need to launch
i owe it to the world to launch
i am sitting on the solution to overthrow corruption
therefore i am corrupt by sitting on it.

i need to launch.
not just for myself, but also for this world

i am arrogant
i sound arrogant
perhaps it is true
but perhaps i am right~ (that i need to launch [for the world (i know i need to launch for myself is true)])




fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck

so sick
so BLEH
i feel like a barf vomit splatter squirted out of some rocks
and i'm just laying there
there aren't any other vomits
i am the first of my kind

there is magma flowing underground
and i am trying to 
ACTIVELY TRYING TO
gain self awareness
and assemble myself
and get up
and walk around

guh
i suck at metaphors


this typing makes me feel good htough
outputting makes me feel good

i know nobody is listening right now
but what makes it feel good is:

a) the act of outputting
b) knowing with relative certainty that i'm not being ripped off


i trust this devbox at least a tiny bit
maybe i shouldn't

i fear deletion etc and hard drives bit rot etc etc etc

but i'm relatively certain (lolloolol famous last words) that i'm not being ripped off


and that's why i need to launch

SO I CAN KNOW WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT I AM NOT BEING RIPPED OFF

better to know you're being watched than to wonder if you are being watched~
^i've said this countless times before

fuck paranoia
fuck shame
fuck vanity (idk why i'm including this, it's my parents' thing... not mine)



will my barf vomit lava be a base for a mountain
buried

or will i grow into a statue of my own and be an image of reference

posing nekkid like dem old dudes n shit (ceasar was it?)

striking that 'thinking' pose all serious and whatnot

yyyyeeeeeee


i refuse to be buried
if i can help it (i can since i am not yet dead) i will not allow myself to be buried

i must launch
for myself at least

whether it helps the world is irrelevant

we must live for ourselves because trying to save everyone is a waste of a life and is impossible
there will always exist idiots (unfortunately... and i'd LOVE to be proven wrong)


you must make your own life happy
worthwhile
whatever word you want to use
"cool"
"badass"
etc

fucking be a god damn serial killer if you need to be (not talking to steven, talking to my READERs here)

it makes no difference
kill kill kill

just know you will eat yourself alive
your brain will consume you
paranoia
unable to sleep
etc

all that is worth living for comes from within
within your own fucking brain
you decide if your life is worth it
if you enjoy it
it's not an outside judge
if you can find peace in killing
go for it


but you'll probably prove yourself wrong
and by then it will be too late
you cannot undo what you have done

steven cannot undo what he has done

you have to make do



being a serial killer means you can probably never be in LAUNCHED 100% mode like i want to do
you'd have to admit your killings
and then you'd go to prison
gg

don't do it

yes, i want to too
but don't do it

guilt and paranoia will eat you alive

your brain owns you
your brain IS you
your brain is the entire world you know
there is no outside judge


i mean sure there's judges that bang wooden hammers and send you to prison
but they can't make you think differently
you can still be happy for what you have done

perhaps in the future we can modify brains in this way (HMMMM mb we can rid ourselves of stupidity)
but at present it is impossible
