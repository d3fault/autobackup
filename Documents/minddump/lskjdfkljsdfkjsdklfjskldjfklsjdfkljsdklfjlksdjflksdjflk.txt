fuck you all suck my dick (please) (and thank you)
arguably, please and thank you is manipulative behaviour. i suppose it depends on whether or not you consider "manipulative" to include only bad or both good and bad behavior. if you say manipulative behavior includes good, then whether or not saying please and thank you is manipulative is true. however, you might still be saying please/thank-you for bad SOCIOPATHIC-manipulative reasons.
