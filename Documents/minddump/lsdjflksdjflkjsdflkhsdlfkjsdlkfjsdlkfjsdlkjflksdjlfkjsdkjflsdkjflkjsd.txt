A baby scorpion was on my left calve. I felt something crawling around down there, acknowledge it might be a bug (psbly even a spider), or maybe a hallucination/itch. I calmly batted it off the back of my leg and onto the floor. Since I did feel something with my finger, I looked down onto the ground where it would have landed and indeed I saw something crawling. Turned on a light and sure enough, it was a little <= 1 inch scorpion crawling around. I think my lack of fear is the only reason I didn't get stung. Years of practice after learning that 'animals can smell your fear' is what saved me from enlightment: that's right, I'm kinda curious what it feels like [man]. I wonder if it'd be so painful that I'd trip fucking ballws and maybe it'd feel good [man] after a few minutes [of extruciating pain]. Well I'm not brave/dumb enough to intentionally get stung, but still how many people could say they've batted a fucking scorpion off the back of their leg? I thought it so absurd that I kept saying to myself "this must be a lucid dream" and expecting it to become one. I did my dream tests and sure enough I was awake. Still so fucking weird. I have no idea how it got their, maybe it crawled from the bottom of my chair onto my leg or maybe I had recently put some shorts on and it was chillen in them (I don't remember if I had recently put shorts on: maybe).

I batted it away calmly like I would any other bug: without fear/panic. It's all about relaxing. You gotta just relax and react: be fast when you BAT, but don't let your fastness come from fear/panic. I'm also midly surprised it didn't sting my finger/hand when I batted it (although I did feel "something" (confirming it wasn't an itch)).
