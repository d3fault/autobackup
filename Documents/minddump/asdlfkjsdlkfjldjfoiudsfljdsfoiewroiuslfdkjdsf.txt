since we can't prove whether or not this is a duplicating universe, we do not know scientifically whether technology is merely being discovered vs. truly being invented. it is also plausible that there's a "god"(or... "super")-discovery that will be claimed by only a single person because in his and everyone around him's mind, it is an "invention". this has nothing to do with the previous document, just elaborating (had: commenting) on the discovered vs. invented insignificance (to that doc)
