I will live less politically.
I have written about and dreamt about open/free/whatever COMMUNITIES
'cube grid' or some such

There are probably many faults in it

We definitely need to IMPROVE from current, but I don't want to dedicate my life to that
At least not directly

I want to dedicate my life to, myself, and to the communication/voting(?) tools required for that society to EMERGE (it will not be anything remotely close to what i described).



I might take a few of those 'goals' off my list. Sure, I may or may not solve world hunger.... but I might just stop at "here's the INSTRUCTIONS on how to build a robot farm"... instead of dumping money into trying to create a society/actual-place-to-live. I don't fucking know. I might change my mind about that too. I am just going to flale around. Whatever sounds good is what I will do. Life is too short and I have way too many goals. There is also a huge risk of death in acting politically. Ah fuck it. I dunno. I am a pussy but I don't want to be.
