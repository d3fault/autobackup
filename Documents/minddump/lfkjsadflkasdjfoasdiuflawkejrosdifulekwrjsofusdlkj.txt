i am standing here on earth looking up breathing heavily with a giant smile on my face
trying to keep up with the information explosion currently happening
i want to freeze this moment
i want to (and am going to) freeze this life
because the information explosion WILL catch up
and i am born way too young
err too soon
i guess both?
but i meant to say soon

i think it's amazing that we have such amazing freezing technologies already existing


i am surrounded by information, not physical substance (in the visual i am describing, that is. information looks like a picture + frame btw ;-). i guess this would be my tobey-family-tree-stand-up-act)
we are information
self aware information
each time we create ourselves, our bodies are random formations
this time we are bipedal (upright humans)
i am addicting to news of information
actual information
not what they show on the news
though the current day real news probably would show the "actual information" ALSO... in addition to other bullshit

it is a very reasonable hypothesis that freezing a human will work
shame scientists themselves don't see the irony in wanting proof of it working before being willing to try/test it
