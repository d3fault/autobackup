Dreams:
I was hanging onto her arm and/or sitting next to her (hugging her arm while putting my arm through the hole between her under-arm and her body), and she thanked me for something (enlightenment or some such? not sure tbh). I replied: "don't thank me, I didn't give you free will".


California house and I went back to my room (dad's old office, also my old as hell room) and I thought about how "this is what life has become" and wanted to just leave and go down into the ravine and lay in silence in a pup tent. I began to cry and it felt great. Wondered if I'd be crying irl too but then reasoned since my dad's the only one home he probably wouldn't here it anyways (this applied to both in the dream and out of it).


Talking with Madison on a couch who was older (maybe like 11) and fatter (fatter than she'll ever really be).. can't remember what we talked about but it was pleasant and relatively intelligent.


At neighbor's at current house and their backyard is much bigger than it really is. One of the angelines was playing on a monkey bar above caydon who was on a swing, and I asked her to get down so she wouldn't maybe fall on caydon. There was something else too but I can't remember, but just after that I started wandering off "up" some hill to a high dive at the top of the hill. Planned on doing my usual 1 1/2 with full twist (baller sup) and considered/wondered if it qualified as "showing off" to HER (it probably does but who gives a shit). During the journey up the hill there were thorny plants and such. Was not an easy climb. Yes, this is my life in it's entirety in a metaphor :-P. Have fun + show off (simultaneously) + die.
