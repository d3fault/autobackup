It's weird but true that right now there's absolutely nothing I want to be doing (aside from smoking weed) except coding DesignEqualsImplementation2. I am having the time of my life. I'm glad that the Abc bullshit is done, I can finally go back to coding for fun (although if I were smarter I'd be fucking broadcasting my coding of designEquals and making money doing it -_- (FUD)). I don't even feel like tripping balls (not entirely true, I'd go for some low grade acid (something to just relax on) right about now). Oh cool look I contradicted myself twice already, this doc is stupid... but eh the point remains that I guess "of all the options AVAILABLE TO ME right now, I choose coding designEquals"
