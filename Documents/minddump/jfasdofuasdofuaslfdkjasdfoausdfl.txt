it just hit me how much more smart i must be than bill gates, steve jobs, woz, et al
i'm definitely not the smartest person around,
but those guys built operating systems with no knowledge of programming
they had to invent it as they went
i'm lucky to be at a point where Qt/C++ exists
the wheel has already been invented
current operating systems suck
but they're what we have
they're "the first bunch"

i am smarter than i give myself credit for. i think/know i could build an "Operating System"
