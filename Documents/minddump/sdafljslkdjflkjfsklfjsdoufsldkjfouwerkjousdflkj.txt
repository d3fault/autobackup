Music vidyo
Guy (hmm I wonder who hurrr) sitting in chair listening to catchy electronic music, two monitors in front of him and the camera rotates showing both his emotionless ("default" aka no-muscles-active) facial expression (he's too focused on the code) and the contents of both screens. On the right monitor is scrolling white-on-black text (currently compiling Qt), on the left is Vim themed Qt creator (current focus) with some project open. Teh camera spins around and then zooms into his eye and into his brain, where we see a ball of electricity bouncing to the music like those music visualizers. His entire body is motionless (aside from active-as-fuck-typing-hands (I screw like I type)), but at the end we see his right big toe tapping against the wall his foot is pressed against.
