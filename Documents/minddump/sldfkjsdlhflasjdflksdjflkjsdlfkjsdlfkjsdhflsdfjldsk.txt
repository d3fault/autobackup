It is, or should be (imo ;-P), illegal for subjectivity to be allowed into law. It is unreasonable for a government to expect it's citizens to abide by any law that can be interpretted subjectively. A person only has the ability to interpret it for themselves; punishing someone for interpretting a subjective law differently from their peer(s) is stupid.

On the other hand, "reasonable person" lingo has no choice but to exist in certain areas of law.

It's becoming just like the military and their overly censored attitude. It's too easy for lawmakers to write a subjective law, just as it is too easy for the military to classify the accidental killing of civilians caught on tape as "a matter of national security".

Subjective laws can make several orders of magnitude more "things" illegal than the author originally intended, and are therefore harmful to society.

Eventually everything will be subjectively illegal. When that happens, I'm going to flip out and become a serial killer (I won't have a choice).
