In a strange sense, I can justify killing those who would keep the truth away from the people. I don't think I _WILL_ justify it, but I think I _COULD_. I mean... 5-meo-dmt... is a means of exploring your brain. You can read my words all you want but until you fucking trip balls and think certain thoughts for yourself, you'll still be firmly grounded as human [only]. You'll accept your 5-senses reality as all that there is and will never swim in the realm of abstract thought. You will never fully understand "we are one".

I could see power whores... politicians and the like... coming down from an informative trip and saying "we should keep this away from the people".


Don't those fuckers deserve to die? Isn't murdering them and bathing in their blood justified?



Surely it would land me in prison, but I really only need to justify it to myself as not being evil. I don't think it would be evil. I think the people deserve to know the truth, regardless of how scary or whack or crazy it is. Those who would keep the truth from the people are the enemy of... the people (and me).



It's really the only case I can think of where murder is justified... aside from of course the preservation of life. That's why I'm pretty hesitant on it.



Isn't keeping the "1" from evolving further just as bad as murder itself? That's a tough ethical question but my instincts do say yes.




I am not the 1. We are the 1. (So I guess I, _TOO_, am the 1)
