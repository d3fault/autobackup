For my last.fm ripper, I should allow (default at 4.9 hits-per-second, as 5 is the max in their terms. they can change the rate too before or during the operation) the user to click "unthrottle" while we are downloading and showing a progress bar and explaining why it's taking so long. i should warn them that they risk getting their IP banned. This is such an easy app I'm thinking about coding it and releasing binaries on Facebook for it.

Why?
WHy is that significant?
Because if I wasn't the author of them, I would not be allowed to post executables on Facebook.
Or at least I wouldn't have a reasonable excuse to (or not to, i forget which).
