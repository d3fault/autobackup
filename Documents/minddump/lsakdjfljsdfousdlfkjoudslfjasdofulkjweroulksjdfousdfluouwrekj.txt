My tears are the dragging "OOMPH". I have never cried while listening to music or watching certain movies (the blue scene in 5th element for example) or just when having certain thoughts. I am going soo incredibly slow that it's making me cry. I'm wasting this precious life. THE most precious resource.

Excitement/Anticipation/MONEY/SEX/DRUGS/Boredom/etc don't do it for me anymore.... these tears are holding onto my body and dragging me along. If I didn't have them I'd have given up and/or killed myself.

I still FEEL all of the above (excitement) from time to time... but they aren't... motivating factors anymore. Or if they are, they aren't working good enough. THESE TEARS have me at a rate > 0. I cannot stop and procrastinate anymore. I've taken so long that that dragging slow tear rate has finally caught me and will never let go (I could still speed up ofc).
