I do feel bad for my parents
I do feel bad for Caydon

but I am doing this for myself
A man needs to be self centered to an extent

serving others indefinitely is a waste of life and can drive a man insane
not that I'm serving others all that much..
..but modifying my will (not going) for them counts.

I refuse on principle.

I hope adult Caydon would too.
