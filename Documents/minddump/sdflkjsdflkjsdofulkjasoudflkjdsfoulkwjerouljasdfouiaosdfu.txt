I may or may not have heard Caydon on the other side of my door saying "Uncle Steven!"... but I have no clue if I actually heard it or not. Regardless, makes me sad as fuck. I hope he understands this (ALL OF THIS. EVERY FUCKING LINE OF IT) when he's older. I don't want to make him sad NOW but I know that will be the effect. I need to live for myself for him. I can never be truly happy and then can't pass along that happiness like the contagious virus that it is... unless I focus entirely on myself at this period in my life. I love him. I love me. I am doing this for him. I am doing this for ME.
