Considering putting this on a piece of paper on my door on the day I launch (to/for my parents): "I don't hate you guys, but you make me feel embarrassed, which makes me motionless and silent.".

Still not sure how to solve the water/food/piss/poop problem (I have to go out there and make eye contact and small talk with them!!!!!! FFFFFFFFFF !!!!!!!!!! THE-DOWNFALL-OF-STEVEN !@!##!@$@#%@%#@#$@#$ (lol)), maybe I'll just go in and out of my fucking window, directly to the world.
^Is why I wanted so much to move out before launch. Fuck it, I have no choice anymore. Launching Abc2 before Hvbs (a strategy for moving out before launch) is waaaaaaaaaay the fuck too dangerous. The only safe place for my files is in the public.
