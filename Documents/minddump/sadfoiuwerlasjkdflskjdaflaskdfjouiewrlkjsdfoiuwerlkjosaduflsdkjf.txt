I told myself to fuck around. I went to the bathroom and was staring at myself in the mirror while I washed my hands... and I was saying I should install couchbase on my devTESTbox and write some basic test app for it....... even if the test app itself isn't saved I would still be familiarizing/USING couchbase [for the first time] (up until now I've only read docs/examples/etc). I guess since I won't be saving the results (I could... but it isn't worth the effort... they'll be on RAM)... I consider it "fucking around". But still, knowledge will be gained! It certainly is not! The libraries and programming languages/frameworks I am comfortble using were all mostly learned via "fucking around". To read about the library is theoretical... to use it in a basic ass stupid fucking test app... is actual. You gain a confidence IN YOURSELF (even though it is not your library) just by seeing (feeling? experiencing?) it compile and run.

I am off now... to go fuck around...
