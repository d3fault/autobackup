If I launch ABC without launching HVBS simultaneously, I run the risk of never launching HVBS because I'll be waiting until "my environment grants me freedom of speech" (my primary argument FOR launching ABC before HVBS) -- and it will never come. I'm tempted to rewrite my conditional into "launch hvbs right when I move out". But even then: I fear the success, ease, and comfort that ABC will have brought me (after all, I have enough currency to move out) will have taken me over the same way greed takes over all men.

There's also the consideration that ABC may stir up some politics. Legal nonsense that, to put it plainly, needs a bold face attached. Bitcoin is young and in a legal grey area. "They" could easily pursuade (had:buy off) some government agency to shut down ABC. If it's just a site operated by a greedy fucktard (err, *businessman), shutting it down will be easy for "them". If, however, I'm launched (HVBS), they are CENSORING ME and in that case it would cause more of an uproar. It's hard to exactly describe it, but basically ABC runs the risk of getting shut down by "them" if I'm not hvbs-launched simultaneously. The way "they"'d shut me down if I'm hvbs-launched is by shooting me in the face, and luckily I don't have to deal with those consequences (I'll be dead).

I'm more worried about the first paragraph. Second paragraph is just paranoia nonsense I've realized. [Second paragraph] COULD happen, probably won't.

I'm afraid of my own greed. I know Abc2 is worth a mild amount (and compared to the zero I'm making, that's an infinite percent increase!)...
