Security is contextual. Example: A journaling filesystem is both more secure and less secure. It is less secure because "shredding" a file no longer gives defined results (read Truecrypt's doc about Journaling filesystems). It is more secure because it can save you from data loss during a power outage. I guess really these are two different forms of security... but the original claim is still true (fuckit).
