i want 1/3 of the profit to go to me, the owner
2/3 of the revenue goes to itself. as in, it is used to pay for developers and servers and other shit like that. as purely a mental cookie, i could rig it so that some of the 2/3 revenue is paid towards me for development time... but that's the same as asking for more than 1/3, which i could do at any time. or perhaps i am bound to 1/3? is that even possible? i think it just may be (read: is). is it worth doing? i paused hella long before that last sentence (not this one (but obv. incl.))
