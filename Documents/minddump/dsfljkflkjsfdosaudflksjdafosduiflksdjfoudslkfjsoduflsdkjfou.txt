Just as death gives you an appreciation of life, [something goes here and I forget what it was]. The part I forgot may have also gone in front of the comma as well.

Might have been art related but idk lol.


OT'ish (thought of this while trying to remember): If we live infinitely, we are guaranteed to get bored eventually. Just like that "Sphere" movie: we have the power to forget (by dying :-P).

Not only are we guaranteed to get bored eventually, but hell it might never have gotten interesting to begin with! Somehow knowing we're going to die makes us appreciate the time we are alive.

It isn't JUST that, though. A computer/robot knowing it will be unplugged still does not appreciate being powered on. It takes self awareness, but not just THAT, either!!! Very easy to say: bool iAmAComputer = true; -- technically that would be self awareness (ok arguably the computer would have to set that bool itself, sure). An understanding.... and probably a key element is emotion.... is necessary for that appreciation of life.

Hmm here's a thought that's probably true: our fear of death (aka paranoia!!!!!!) is what makes us appreciate life. We are programmed to fear death because those animals that didn't have that fear (on a micro scale here) died off... and consequently the inverse/side-effect/whatever of that fear of death was, eventually, an appreciation of life!

So we cannot say we appreciate life. We can only say we fear death. But really they are the same thing...
