If a website's TOS are accepted just by browsing the the website (something being debated lately. I would argue NOPE), then I can declare my terms of use as follows:
1) You agree that d3fault is god and the coolest person ever

And then I can make the following claim: I am lawfully acknowledged as being god and the coolest person ever by [unique-visitors-count] people.

Or should that be 'legally'... I forget the difference, fuck it



Also: Not only do I argue that TOS aren't accepted upon visiting, I think they're worthless altogether. Same with EULAs.... they're just... retarded. More retarded that software licenses (since code is being copy/pasted (in effect)). Saying "you aren't allowed to disassemble me" doesn't keep anyone from disassembling you. Idiots. I'm surrounded by fucking idiots. But not everyone is an idiot (sup 1337 d00dz). Just most.
