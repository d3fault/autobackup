There is either a mathematical formula behind what makes music sound "good", OR, humans are true RNGs.
I'm quite certain that statement is true and I'm thrilled at both sides of the or statement!!!

I would like to code an auto-music-composer for fun.... but I'd gladly accept that it's not possible if it means that we are true RNGs. True RNGs would essentially confirm free will (but not that we aren't repeating hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha).
