living here sobers me
this different train of thought that portishead - dummy vaguely reminds me of
that i can only get while peaking

is fleeting and forgotten living here
with my parents
with lexi (who makes me want to cry, poor prisoner animal)

etc

i need to get the fuck out of here
we define our own realities

reality in 2012 sucks

buildings tall
shitty dubstep
corrupt internet
corrupt business
corrupt government

BLOCK IT OUT OF YOUR MIND AND IT DOES NOT EXIST


i want an underground nuke proof bunker where i can live until i die
and just code and dance and trip
that's really all there is to it

notice how i didn't mention sex?
fuck sex.

(haha fuck means sex too)

SEX SEX

future readers might have a hard time inferring

"forget sex"

though i doubt it

fuck isn't THAT hard to derive


such a versatile word :-P


fuck fucking >_>

i dunno what ima do underground
mb just lop off my cock

but then i'll be less of a man
it will change my brain
which i am not ok with.

mb just some whores n shit

some occassional visitors just to slob on my knob

but idk i also think about having like a group of friends or people whose company i actually enjoy living down there with me


idfk


i can do anything i want
nothing is set in stone


but dance/code/trip should be the basis of my life


i can't wait for the first time i can do all 3 reliably (will take a while before i can play music)

oh i didn't mention the music part
but that's implied with dancing imo

play music + dance to it
code
trip


original purity
or some such fuck shit butt ass dick

that is my goal in life.

my old goals in life (silly):
1) own/ride crotch rocket
2) get laid
3) sky dive

still haven't sky dived... but will someday


but those goals are fucking lame

i knew they were lame when i came up with them
but i knew they were reasonable / attainable

that's why i chose them


my new goal is much more OOOOMMMFFF

much more difficult
because of the prerequisites

but still definitely very reasonable / attainable


and that's it

after that i can just lay over and die
or do it again and again and again

or perhaps throw sky diving into the mix
or even (brace for lulz):

sky dive while having sex on a crotch rocket while making music and dancing and coding and tripping

possible.

hell yea

you know what...
that's a bonus goal: why not? :-D
