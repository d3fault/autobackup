If I am absolutely sure I am dreaming and am lucid, I can give myself permission to do anything.

It is a dangerous habit however because it is possible to think you are dreaming when you are in fact awake or tripping. Perhaps lock yourself in a padded room for the duration of those particular trippy drugs. All I really need is the ability to output (and that my output won't be intercepted/etc).... and to know I can leave later of course. I think I could handle hours in there by choice.

We should have drug amusement parks (said this before). Safety should be a huge priority.

We should also require a certain level of intelligence before tripping.... but determining the threshold is difficult as fuck.
