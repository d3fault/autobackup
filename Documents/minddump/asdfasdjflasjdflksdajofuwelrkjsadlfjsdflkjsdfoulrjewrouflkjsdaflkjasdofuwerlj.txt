One thing broadcasting live 24/7 will gain me is that friends won't ask me for help with... confidential matters. If a friend asks you to help them get away with murder (thought of this during the graveyard digging scene of kill bill 2), you are risking yourself greatly. You are now vulnerable to all of your friend's mistakes. I know I could get away with murder, but I'd never put my trust in a friend's ability to get away with murder. You know? I am not them, therefore I cannot be as safe/sure that no evidence was left behind.


This is all negated by broadcasting live 24/7. They won't even both asking. I won't feel bad saying 'nope'. They won't guilt/pressure/threaten me into it. Pull some fucking "you owe me!" card. Fuck prison. Friends suck sometimes.


Keep your crimes to yourselves dipshits.
