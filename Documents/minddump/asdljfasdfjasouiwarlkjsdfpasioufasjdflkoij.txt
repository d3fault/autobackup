don't forget that in any case, you're DEFINITELY going to need a bitcoin/public/steven-associated 'FRONT' to launder your coins into
i mean or you can just be legit and not have to worry about it. still unsure what projects i want anon or not

massage exchange, for example, i would probably definitely want anon... laundering the money (or just doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING with it) into a public projet (say, AdAgency... if i decide to use that one as public)
the method of laundering for massage exchange would be to let the money fucking sit. AdAgency's cut would be the main 'laundered' money, even though it would be a relatively small amount. growing the portion of the market that you own is good even for the small amounts). i could use unlaundered (well, LESS laundered money) to pay for servers etc

god i have so many cool opportunities with being a general badass
laundering money etc
reality
no dependencies on any 3rd parties
it's awesome being a nerd
