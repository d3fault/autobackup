I'm not solving how to survive or even how to have a bit of fun. I'm solving the problem presented in the movie "Primer": if you have all the money and all the time in the world, what do you do?


The reason my software is superior to Google/Microsoft/Apple/Yahoo! software is simple: they are in the profitable software business, I'm in the awesome software business. Making "profitable" a bullet point in your list of requirements for a given piece of software rules out way too many awesome softwares.
