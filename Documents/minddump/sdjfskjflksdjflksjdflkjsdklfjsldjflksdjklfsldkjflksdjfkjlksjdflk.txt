I wish I understood how a camera works. How do light particles become zeros and ones? Fascinating.

Maybe if I do some research I can find out to a level of understanding acceptable to me, just like when I tried to figure out how to bind a bool to a led/toggle-switch, I was pleasantly surprised with how much more I could do via Arduino (potentiometers are SUHWEEET, servos look easy/fun too). But in all fairness, I still don't know how a[n] [n]and gate works (I know what it does, just not how it does it).

I wrote this doc only because of the [n] [n] part. It was just a thought up until that point.


OT'ish: the curiosity of binding a bool to a led/toggle is the same curiosity responsible for music fingers (I discovered potentiometers just minutes later (bought an Arduino minutes later (it was the C example code that sold me. I was like "NO FUCKING WAY, IT'S _THAT_ EASY!?!?!?"))). Became a hardware god in a matter of minutes (years of software training made that possible). LibArduino, LibIrl. Just like libs in software give you assloads of functionality for free/cheap, so to does Arduino allow me to delve into the hardware world with very little knowledge of hardware. I _still_ don't know the difference between watts/volts/amps... seriously you guys they all 3 sound the same to me. I've read the fucking water pressure analogy dozens of times, still can't grasp it, despite understanding the analogy (I can SEE water so I know what 'water pressure' is (shit spurts out of cracks in pipes, for example). 'electricity pressure' makes no fucking sense to me). I _still_ don't know how a resistor works. If it weren't for step by step tutorials on how to wire dat shiz, I'd be in the dark (I was confused that something so amazing/powerful as a potentiometer didn't require extra components such as a resistor... and then later I read that a potentiometer _is_ a resistor xD. An LED is a piece of shit compared to a potentiometer, yet requires more assembly/components :-?. Fuckit).
