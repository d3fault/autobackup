yes that is it
i'm just afraid
afraid of being wrong
that i might live longer and enjoy it more
that success isn't even worth trying for because it is unattainable

that i will enjoy living in shadows
pulling strings

perhaps even being the most evil motherfucker known to man

i could live a life in teh shadows
be a 'h4x0r' etc

no name

no ..
.. or less
fear.

but perhaps more, if i'm right

paranoid at the very least

but rightful paranoia is justified

there are some fucked up powerful people in this world (i can be one of them).

so

paranoia with less (err what's the word)
or
paranoia-free with complete

the word i'm looking for is like reveal

the less i reveal the more likely i am to not be killed for it
but i also reason that being out in the open might save me

make me a hero of sorts
not that i care about that (i do), but i'll have followers/protectors implicitly
which i don't have if i'm unknown/nameless/behind-the-scenes/alone

i trust no-one
currently

and am less paranoid because of it
but cold turkey'ing that paranoia is my next step
err that trust*

or is it
it isn't sort of

just because i put EVERYTHING on the table doesn't mean i trust... anyone
it changes nothing regarding trust
it makes it so i don't have to hide anything

but drugs factor in
i want to do drugs
lots and lots of drugs

which i'd have to hide or else face legal consequences

maybe i can do it winky
like 'quick dinner' style
;-)

but i fear that won't last indefinitely
or that it may trigger a sting-like operation
a rational fear.

justification for going under?

this is probably the biggest decision of my entire life

i want both
as i've said before
but both is a contradiction

one cannot be both 100% truthful and in hiding.
well shit... ^^^that was a breakthrough thought

common sense... but most breakthrough thoughts are.


it's one or the other
there is no both

because if it's both.. then it's the hiding one.

so if i am hiding
i might as well be hiding all the way
because then i at least won't get caught/seen (defeating the purpose of hiding)

as much as i want to say LAUNCH GO FOR IT

i will allow myself to hide
if i choose it
like a coward.


or maybe i can just release everything under pseudonym?
tor style?

best of both worlds

except... cowardly
won't be nearly as powerful

as a name
and a face

people need names and faces to align with
or behind (sameshit)

fuck man... i just don't know...
