Given existence, life is obvious. The emergence of life does not include an inventive step. Therefore, all patents are bullshit.

It's easy to see why patents are granted. Subjectivity in what qualifies as an inventive step (just because something is complex does not mean it contains an inventive step) and the natural desire by the government/politicians for money (USPTO grants patents, regardless of their validity, at ~$10k a pop) are the reasons the patent system exists today. I have never seen anything that I would consider patent worthy. Not even life itself (that's not to say I don't value it).
