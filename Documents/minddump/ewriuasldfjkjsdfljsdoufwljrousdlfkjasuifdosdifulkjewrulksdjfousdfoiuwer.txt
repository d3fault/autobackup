GottaHackEmAll.com

was surprised as fuck it was open, so I bought it :-P

I was really tempted to put the following up as the index, but I don't have a web host atm so lol.


Hacker (n): a being who curiously and playfully studies and improves a system.

while(true)
{
	foreach(Universe universe in Existence::instance()->universes())
	{
		foreach(System system in universe.systems())
		{
			system.hack();
		}
	}
}



I thought about making the method call "hack" be red and a hyperlink to [????]. Maybe perhaps my own launch page, idk. I could do a whole "themed launch" using that domain if I wanted/willed.


Also, Bash should be the name/hacker/whatever associated with the domain. GET IT? HURRRR


I, when thinking it up, only had "Universe universes in Universes" (not showing how Unvierses gets populated (and hell still doesn't (just shows who owns them))). I then while writing it had: Existence.universes() ..... but finally decided to make Existence a Singleton :-P...
