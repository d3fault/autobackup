it's traditional to pick a direction and stick with it
to be a person of... integrity

people spend their entire lives on a single... persona

i hope and wish to be all over the place
i can and should contradict myself
i want to invite people to point out non-obvious corrections (i should notice the obvious)

i want to be a saint
and an asshole

i want to think logically
and emotionally

i want true chaos

i want to be in control
and to accept that i have none


i want to completely trip balls one day and most everything i document will make no sense
and the next, take some adderall and code some compiling logic (perhaps derived from thoughts the day before)

day in, day out
i want to have some days where i sit and do nothing but think/reflect
where i don't even speak (or think out loud) until i think of something worth saying out loud (because thinking out loud 24/7 might actually cloud my judgement (hopefully not! test this.))
