I am an application compiled with the -O3 compiler flag optimization. Instead of just sucking in "regular" libraries I depend on, I also suck in the c[++] standard libraries, the entire kernel, and a subconsience.bin firmware module. We are each unique hardware, operating system, and application [that CAN replicate itself 1:1 ([most likely] excluding experiences), but rarely does in a single "big bang instance" (clones/twins exist)].
