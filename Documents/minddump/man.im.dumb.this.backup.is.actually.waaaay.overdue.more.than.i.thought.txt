ignorance is bliss

and i shouldn't do backups while drunk anymore
dumbass.

a) backed up my ~/autobackup/ folder instead of /mnt/750x*/ structure.. which has the git push copy of ~/autobackup/ plus lots of other shit (pics etc)
b) left my truecrypt key in the 'backup' folder of keepass file, right after making the password really short. this one is less my fault.. but still


also, regarding (a), if i just get the structure and also copy dirstructure.txt manually into my static backup, i don't have to worry about getting ~/autobackup/
timestamps were the only reason i wanted to get ~/autobackup/ manually (on top of the /mnt/750x*/ structure.. since git push doesn't do timestamps)

basically what (a) means is that my 1tb drives don't have even old copies of /mnt/750x*/ structure... because i overwrite it with a truecrypt file every time hahaha. they only have ~/autobackup/... which is useful but doesn't contain everything i want

i should put the dirstructure.txt file in /mnt/750x*/autobackup/, even though it's a push-only git repo folder
(but this is only true during staticBackup creation shit)
