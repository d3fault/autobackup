live your life as if it were a book

think about what you would want to read about a character doing in a book

and then do it

write a book


i can target my 180k years away audience

make them envy my position

it is certainly... pinnacle? peak'y
pivotal?
idfk the word to use
but i am the one who got to choose

man love those last 2 ste ... sentences

got
gets
sameshit

if you refer to the now from a future perspective, it's got
but the immediate future is gets

and since you aren't currently doing, it isn't got
it's 'will do'

or..
..was planning to do?

confusing nonsense

all irrelevant
to the original thought


i can and will literally define the future
180k years from now might be still using the template
the shell of a human
the launch codes
rofl.
i am building a giant button
that should be available at birth.
