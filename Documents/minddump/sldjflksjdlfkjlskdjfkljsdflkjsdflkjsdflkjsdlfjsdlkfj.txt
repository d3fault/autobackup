Life: The Relativity Balance

Stupid makes you appreciate smart
Bad makes you appreciate good
Pain makes you appreciate pleasure
Death makes you appreciate life
Poor makes you appreciate rich

You can't have any on the right without having the counterpart on the left; but out of all of them, I think "no rich without poor" is the worst: the poor starve to death. "Normalcy" is not about getting rid of rich and poor (if that happened, there would be no incentive to create). Normalcy is about making the bare minimum life that government provides (through taxation) taking "survival" out of the equation. Give them food and shelter (preferably sound/bullet proof place to be themselves (peer pressure is stupid)), and eventually society will reap the benefits of their boredom (creative thinking).

Intelligence is important too, but your intelligence doesn't cost others. Everyone can be smart; there is no see-saw that must go down as you go up.
