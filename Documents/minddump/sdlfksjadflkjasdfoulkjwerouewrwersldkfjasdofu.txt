I am a control freak, even when I lose control.... because I always need/want to have the ability to lose control. I control the very fact that I lose control.

Coding is ultra control mode, and BDSM (which I've barely experimented with) is "losing control" (well depending what role I play). Since I throw myself in it, and I decide to throw myself in it, I am still in control when losing control.

Drugs also make you "lose control", but in a completely different fashion.


I am in control of knowing that I am not in control. Life is chaos is random is death is life is death is life [...]


Control is "important", so during my sober state I tend to try to tame it to the best of my abilities. Programming is the main form of that manifestation.
Deep down I know I am not in control, so I load my brain into a metaphorical cannon, aim it at the universe, and fire (lol plagairism).

It's my way of [controlling to choose] variety. It's my way of playing hop scotch over the line between sanity and insanity. I am in control because my code and logic-in-my-fucking-brain compiles. I am not in control because I know nothing and everything is random and arbitrary.


This doc sucks.
