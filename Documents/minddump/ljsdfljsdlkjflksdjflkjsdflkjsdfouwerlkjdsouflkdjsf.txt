When I am content, I want to preserve my state (I fear death). When I am discontent, I want to improve my situation (I do not fear death).
What the fuck?
Bipolar is logical.

Edit: Worth noting (for the tards) that when when content and exerting effort into preserving state (fearing death), I eventually become discontent. When discontent and fearlessly improving my situation, I eventually become content and it keeps toggling forever (but at least I understand it, maybe I can hack a solution into my brain (BE CONTENT; DO NOT FEAR DEATH; (the semicolons here mean they are commands to myself))
