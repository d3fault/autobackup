The rate at which technology will advance given the current free market and the typical technological company startup business plans is ridiculously slow, especially when factoring in patents. I am going to code (both single handedly and via outsourcing [where I get the copyright and set it free/libre]) a ton of businesses and/or business ideas that could otherwise have been stretched out and provided thousands of humans entire careers if done in a proprietary fashion (see: google). Some might say I'm crazy for giving the source away for free, but to me it's worth it because the next 100 years are the most important 100 years (-asian scientist guy) and will in effect tell us whether or not we will sustain (if it turns out we don't, we find out the hard way). I am synthesizing a bootstrap from the current "free market" (capitalism), borrowing the idea of "advertising" and "celebrity" to fund (and document) an entirely open, free/libre, accelerated society/business/internet/THINGY-MA-JIGGER. If I can accelerate human knowledge 500 years (what it would take the proprietary/purely-profit-driven society to do the same thing) over the course of 50 years, I will have considered my work to be "a" contribution to society. Obviously it benefits me as well. I am entirely self centered just as we all are. I want to wake up from being frozen to a better world.
