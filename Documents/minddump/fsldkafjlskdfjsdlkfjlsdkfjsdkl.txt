because i'll miss my old music too much
perhaps i am willing to compromise 100% mode a bit further into allowing myself to listen to ALREADY DOWNLOADED (fuck streams, brainwash) music
i'd have to not allow the music to be outputted through my stream, but should definitely still scrobble the track (and allow them to listen to my random singing lmfao)

it's a slippery'ish slope because i cannot and will not allow adversary's to speak to me in private: death threats etc
death threats are less scary when they are publicized
i will not speak with anyone unless our conversation is BY-SA/public

BUT loophole: record an album, copyright it, the album is the message
so i guess the fix: don't listen to any NEW music that is copyrighted/proprietized
and meh, should i even give the proprietary songs acknowledgement?

contradiction:
-want to scrobble music, even proprietary songs
-not wanting to acknowledge proprietary media

fix(?): encryptedly scrobble (reveal when????)







I AM HOPING that a lot of the artists i enjoy will join my... libre revolution.... librevolution. lib as in library! jk. idfk. (still a good/cool name for a library... think of a place where it'd fit, perhaps a backing library for d3fault :-P)
