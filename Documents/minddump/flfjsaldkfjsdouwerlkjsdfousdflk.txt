I could justify running as an formal lolitician if and only if I do not lie about the self-centered'ness around it. I would explain that I'm no different than the rest of them (they would refute this), just that I do not lie about it.

"Represent Constituents" = "Represent Everyone" = "Represent Myself"


To say you represent certain constituents for a defined border of population is utter bullshit. They make the claim during the election season but conveniently forget all about it and focus only on what is important to them.

I could do the same, but I'd still be... obligated.... and forced into (with extra emphasis as I am entirely transparent)... caring about _ALL_ the bills in which I must vote on. Yea fuck that. I think politicians should be forced to use such a transparent system, but it definitely doesn't sound fun (why does being a politician mean you need fun? we (the people) need to keep the politicians in check by using mentioned transparency techniques (such transparency techniques are only helpful if the candidate utilizing them is genuinely transparent. it is easy to appear 100% transparent but to do things "off camera" even still (i could devote myself mentally to it (and i will (with life/software)), but i think overall i would be bored senseless by the responsibilities i'd feel obliged to bow to. it WOULD set an example for politics indefinitely, but it would also consume my life, and time is finite))).
