i think i could be profitable just by releasing my dreams in a fucking book or on a blog with ads... that's how easy it is to be profitable. it's horse shit that i'm trying so damn hard (though i'm basically making it foolproof :-D)


i really really really hope i continue to have trippy as fuck dreams after i have launched and when i am in the public's eye
