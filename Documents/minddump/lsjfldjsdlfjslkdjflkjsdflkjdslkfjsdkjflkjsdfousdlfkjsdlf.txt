[Psychedellic] drugs will likely never be legalized because the control group has no idea what they're missing out on (and the researchers tend to focus only on the negative effects (euphoric mental breakthroughs appear to an observer as nothing at all (and indeed are difficult to put into words), whereas psychotic (had:schizophrenic) breaks are easily identified)). Once they do find out what they're missing out on (and change their mind into agreement and admit they were wrong), they are no longer part of the control group. This is sadly a problem with the scientific process that I and many others are unable to come up with a solution to.
