Orig thought: If I were to die soon, that would be 15 billion years wasted.

Then it took me to teh 'basketball' concept. Life likely doesn't emerge with every [big] bang. Could take trillions (or insert big number here) of 'years' for life to emerge.

Am I then wasting trillions+ of years?

Or does such thought (and confidence in it) only give me confidence in IMT?

I am what infinity has been working towards for so long. Sure I can/have repeat[ed], but that's irrelevant. There's always a "now", and I have to work towards making mine betterer. Most don't plan enough, I think I'm planning too much.

Semi-OT: Even if you make the argument that "time did not exist before the big bang" (disagree, but whatever/no-matter), there were still infinite previous bangs and the durations of time in each instantiation are concatenated onto each other to form infinite time.
