page 148 of couchbase 2.0 dev preview 4 manual

"Note: there si no way to determine whether a document has been persisted to disk, and therefore no way to determine if a document will be indexed and included in a generated view. this will be addressed in a future release"

what the FUCK

so even if the CAS shit goes ok i still don't know if it's persisted (and therefore ready to be pulled via a View) yet

fucking god damni shitty developers/designers


do i need to code my own custom one? or should i cross my fingers that they address it in a future release/soon?

'eventually consistent' sucks.

why can't they run the view on it while it's only in RAM?



i'm not sure if it matters, like if i (for bank example) check if a transaction exists or whatever
or like see if the slot i am intending to purchase already exists (is already purchased)
i remember seeing the "Add" command


maybe since their view shit sucks (for now) i should just use 1.8 + Qt QDataStream

it works, but is slower
that's about it...

in a network/cluster environment, performance matters
especially when it's the difference between using map/reduce (2.0) or not (1.8)


i don't know
i just hope i don't have to code a custom solution...
