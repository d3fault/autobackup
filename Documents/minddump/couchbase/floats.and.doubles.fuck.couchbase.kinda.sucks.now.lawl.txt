when storing the <username>Balance for a bank account, it should be stored as a string
we parse it to double when we have Qt/C++

json/couchbase only does floats as a native type

so when we do the View that ultimately leads to me balancing out every transaction to zero
we have to do .parseFloat in javascript
after two Group()ings, we are supposed to balance out at zero

because float might not be sufficient (?????), we should respond to a non-zero

by triggering a much slower count/verify

if that much slower count/verify completes, then we record the acceptable error of margin (in a more accurate double format)
future group().group() balance checkings should be zero within that error of margin
a larger one and we we-trigger the slow count/verify again

we could also keep track of each error of margin and report spikes

in any case, it's a huge error if our slow count/verify ever doesn't balance out
