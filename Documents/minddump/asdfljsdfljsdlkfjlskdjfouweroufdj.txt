skidish is a skill that contradicts "blending in" / "going with the flow"
to be skiddish is to not trust impulsively
something even remotely tips you off
you're out of there
to "blend in" you have to override it
it is both unsafe and safer
by blending in you maintain the illusion that nothing is wrong (this is scenario-dependent)
to be skiddish you let the other(s) know that you know something is up (but you are also protected asep?)

deciding the two
balancing the two
is ULTIMATELY the same thing as "will the 6 bullets kill me?"
