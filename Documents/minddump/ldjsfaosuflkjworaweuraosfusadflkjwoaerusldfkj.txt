so i just saw an ad for 'Google Glass... one day'
and i must say it's quite bullshit
i mean i sorta feel like i got ripped off
but anyone could have come up with that
and why glasses? are they too stupid to forsee contacts?

they also missed voting, HUGE loss.
fail.

i am uncomfortable with google owning/selling the data gathered by said glasses
it makes me rage

i feel like a zombie in the Zombie Escape CS:S mod i've been playing the past few days
trying to catch up but when i get even close i get shot back hundres of yards

they have all the resources (guns), i have just myself (knife)

it's stupid though
my paranoia is taking over
i can't let it

i need to proceed at full speed
i need to speed up*
i am fucking dumb
i am slow

my objectives are larger than theirs
project fingers (incl a glasses like interface) will be better
and open source
100%
DHT
encryptor'd

encryptor
i like that
combination of tor and encrypt
but encryption is implicit with tor anyways
so not that great


meh just needed to vent

that video made me feel like i'm fighting a losing battle
but it doesn't matter
i mean it does
but nothing has changed
i still have nothing
nothing to compete with their everything
fucking bastards

i hate google with a passion
'evil' is subjective

the data needs to be public
because it is too easy to be spied on
the only way to have a clear conscience is to know you're being watched
and to be ok with it
privacy is non-existent

glass will give you the illusion of privacy
they will tout it as 'secure'
because it will use SSL
but once it hits their servers they can do whatever the fuck they want with it
bastards

i want to put a bullet through someone's brain right about now
keep your cool
and code

ABC isn't _THAT_ hard, you bitch.
after that it's just a matter of setting up streaming video
you don't need to reinvent the wheel for that one

and then you'll launch
you better do it
you fucking pussy

it's your only hope to catch up
barrier to entry is getting higher and higher year by year
i could write a book called 'barrier to entry' (or... SOMEONE could)
shit's true
we expect too much from kids
