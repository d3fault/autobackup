I want to have a party with Jill Schlessinger, and Mrs. Seymore from the 3rd grade. Perhaps a few others. The teachers I respected. The ones who cared. The ones who were devoted to their job. The ones you can tell loved their job. I want to tell them that they created me. Sure, my parents did too; but I dunno, something about "a good english teacher" just changes the way you think. Parents are like 'food providers'. You learn some shit from them, yea. [Good] Teachers are different. They teach you how to think. How to be an individual. God damnit I keep facepalming at my shitty punctuation but eh fuck the police~


Mrs. Seymore is probably still my favorite, but I don't really remember her all too much. 3rd grade who fuckin knows, I might not even like her anymore. Jill on the other hand I remember fairly well and can say that I admire her persons. Sometimes I just want to send her an email saying "hi" (lol typo there: 'high') and "thank you" or something.... but it'd go nowhere and I'd look pathetic once she asked what I've been up to and I tell her the truth. Maybe after I have some accomplishment[s]. I do want that party after all. Ooooo yea Mrs. Claymore (???) (6th grade) was pretty fucking awesome too. I believe she wants a BMW m3 or m5 or maybe it was a Mercedes? idfk.

That type of teacher deserves infinite wealth.



A lot of teachers tell themselves, or those around them, that they were 'destined for that job'.

They were destined alright: too stupid to do anything else.



The above mentioned teachers do not fall under that category. They are passionate about their jobs as I am passionate about computering ;_P. Yea I'm just fuckin with you guys (girls) now.
