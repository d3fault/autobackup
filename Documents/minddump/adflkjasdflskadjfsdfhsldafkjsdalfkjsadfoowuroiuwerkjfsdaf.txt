i'm up for > 24 hours and am kinda trippin, tis kinda fun

I'm about to attempt this ACK shit, it doesn't sound _THAT_ hard

but I mean I was talking to myself earlier and noticing that I'm saying lots of stupidity [accidentally]
I asked myself if I should be coding under such circumstances

to which I replied to myself: "Yes, because I can back-track / be amused (or something along those lines) and laugh at my mistakes when I try to compile"

fuck yea code
shit catches your fuck ups

no human is perfect
but code has to be to compile
(not implying the design has to be... just no typos etc :-P)
