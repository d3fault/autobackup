we are all the same energy
that is where reincarnation ends
that is where collective consciousness ends

collective consciousness is just recognizing coincidences
if you like the color red, you're going to see the color red
(still i do think tests on collective consciousness are worth doing)


we are the same recycled energy
we are the same recycled molecules
we are the same recycled chemicals
atoms
whatever
whatever word you want to use
that's it, not complicated at all

i don't see it as being feasible that the tiny singular units have a network of communication (to harbour 'spirit(s)' or 'collective conscience' shit)
possible, but not probable/feasible
just unlikely i suppose
coincidences can drive a person crazy
coincidences drive me crazy (unless i really am hacked :-P)
