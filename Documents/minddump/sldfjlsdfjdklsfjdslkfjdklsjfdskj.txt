The days are too short in the winter, the nights too cold for my skinny ass (unless I had a wearable computer I could use while walking around (to stay warm) fml). I've spent some 12+ hour shifts in my sleeping bag, too cold to get up [and code/live/etc], too awake for sleep. But I just now hacked it: I am dangling the ebook reader monitor above where my face sticks out of my "down" sleeping bag. Have USB extension cables for keyboard/mouse to come into the sleeping bag with me. The computer/battery/usb-hub are finally putting the tent's "ceiling cargo net" to good use. On a side note, this arrangement is convenient for fapppin to pr0ndizzle. I may very well fall back into my old pre-tentindesert habit of being a night owl.
