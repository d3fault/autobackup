I wonder if I should outsource more. I mean you can be easily 10x as productive as you are right now just by giving people interfaces to implement and paying for it. I don't have money, but this is something a part time job and/or investment(meh) could easily pay for.


I'm just convinced/hoping my coding will collapse on itself. And it is original programming, I am the user of libraries and frameworks. The guts, the spine, the WORK (copyright legal term), the trademark. What that means is that it's not something you can easily outsource. If it is too good of a "core idea", they will steal it.

I am convinced that a good programmer does not code twice, and that eventually I can be in that ultimate re-use point. My code now sucks, but I am withholding until documenting live creation of said ultimate re-use coding environments. completely automated of course.



Proprietary inventors/creators don't understand the value of community. A fanbase community is worth just as much as a neighborhood community. People are people.
The counter-argument is "money is better than a community/fanbase", of course.
MY counter to that counter is that advertising revenue will make me far more in the long run and at zero cost to my users, thus amplifying the amount of users/potential-ad-clickers/community/fanbase by an order of magnitude. This counter is not used by many, but I can/will use it.
