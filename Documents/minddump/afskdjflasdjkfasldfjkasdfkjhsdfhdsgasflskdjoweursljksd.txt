YES
i can always upgrade to 'hide nothing'

cannot downgrade (except for future events)

HOWEVER

if i don't cold turkey it on launch
i may never 'upgrade' it
out of fear or laziness or who knows what
i think i should decide now

but make note that if you decide to hide everything or somethings, you can change your mind to upgrade later (but you should not plan for it, because it probably wouldn't happen (unless explicitly planned for))
