Ok fine one more doc before continuing (famous last words), this thought has been bouncing around in my brain and is entertaining.

What character do I represent in 5th element?

Lulu: I am the supreme being (technically, we all are... just like we're all God if we know we exist)
Chris Rock: I am a rambler and loud and noisy and sexual
That one main character action hero guy who's name I forget lol: I am a nobody. I am a "Joe Schmoe" (at least for now). I am a good guy (though I don't have any military experience).
zOrg: Self-centered enterpriser. Understands that evil is a necessity. However, I don't wish to kindle evil like he does. Rich as fuck and owns a mega "corporation" (I never want to formally incorporate because I don't ever want to lose my freedom of speech to...... *brace for epic almost put this in it's own doc as it's been bouncing around up there too lol*: sexually harrass. Why do the laws of sexual harrassment only apply to employers? Be a company, lose your freedom of speech. COOL STORY BRO (bro = government))

I am none of the above really. I am an observer/documenter ultimately. I would be willing to sacrifice my life for the universe if I wasn't already so confident that someone else is already willing to do it.

I can chill with the bad guys and the good guys. I don't give a fuck. I don't judge. You want to steal money from people and power grab? Great, go for it. Let's chill and smoke some bowls.

Oh you're in that one movie of which another remake came out and damnit I can't....> DIE HARD IS WHAT IT'S CALLED.... and you want to save the day? Cool lemme grab my vidyo camera so I can watch you kick ass. I'll be smoking bowls while watching btw (you can join but probably won't Mr. GOodie 2'shoes (who also needs absolute concentration as he saves teh universe)).
