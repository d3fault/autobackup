The better I get at typing (the more I let myself go), the more I let myself go [irl]. I am trying to not leak shit all over the place but find myself doing it MORE AND MORE AND MORE. I guess this is why I shouldn't/don't socialize? Or perhaps I need to socialize more in order to learn to control my leaky behavior?

OR, HOW ABOUT THIS (/sarcasm): I LAUNCH INTO A LIBRE-BY-DEFAULT MODE WHERE I CAN COMFORTABLY TALK AND BE MYSELF!!!!!


...just need to get there before I die of old age or off myself.
