we all grow and hope that our acnecestors will want to 'find us' and 'buy our shit'
but i mean sersiously this stupid (to be used as bootstrap) economy actually works
people WILL buy my shit
rofl.
it's a guaranteed mathematically fact
that people will buy my shit
because i can set the minimum to .00000001 bitcoins and that is literally NOTHING
and i could offer an api to auto-buy shit [fee for service is inline-paid, but manual is free... err regular fee, 3%?]
oh my god i am a genius
and i know it

only 1 server out of the localcluster needs to be used to push
actually idk wtf i'm talking about
but i thought i was onto something
