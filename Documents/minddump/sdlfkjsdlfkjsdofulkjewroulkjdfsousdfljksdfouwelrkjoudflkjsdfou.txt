My parents are my bootstrap. Sure they're annoying as fuck at times (for my dad, I'd say the overwhelming vast majority of the time)... but what they're giving me: TIME. The opportunity to code and live my dream: PRICELESS. They are annoying as fuck at times and although I've thought about redacting it, I think they truly do deserve a fucking mansion. But meh, I'd rather give them truth and change their mentalities. That will be a different side goal... and I see it as the real gift. I just hope they accept it (they're Christian).
