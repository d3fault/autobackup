We are one and many simultaneously. Let the "one"'ness bring us closer together/unite-us, let the "many"'ness solve the problem of loneliness. The "saddest thought" (me) or the "saddest frequency" (hannah) is that we live and die alone infinitely repeatedly.... but we aren't alone. We have the various derivatives of ourselves. Whether they are a construct of our mind (imagined) is irrelevant. What seems real is real (if you require more proof, you will "get stuck on that question and whither away" (me)).

We are one because we are all a part of the same universe.
We are many because we each have our own perspective into said universe.
