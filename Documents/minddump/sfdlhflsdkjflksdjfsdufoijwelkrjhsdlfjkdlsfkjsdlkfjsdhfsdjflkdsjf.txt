It's not a matter of learning/knowing-how to code or figuring out the meaning of life. I know both of those to levels of understanding that I deem acceptable (everybody has their own levels). It's simply a matter of survival. I am worried that I will not be able to scale fast enough (as in, I won't have enough money by myself to NOT accept angel money (lose free will in doing so)) to make it over the "hump". might have enough for a little while but then fail later on. i am really just guessing that i will have enough money (not talking about initial/launch costs here, i BARELY have enough for that), i haven not calculated (even roughly) whether or not i'll have enough. i'm just going the "minimize costs and cross fingers" route. Imagine: "he did not achieve his dream because he was worried that it wouldn't float financially and so never tried". I would lol very hard if it failed financially, but for some reason I still have a fear of it (fail = lol, success = woot; neither are bad so WHY THE FUCK DO I GIVE A SHIT? WHY AM I SITTING HERE? of course there are other fears of death as usual, but I've been telling myself that I'm mostly over those. I don't feel like I'm lying about it. Could be denial. So my theoretical "denial self" doesn't have a reason i should be afraid, and neither do i. why then? you pussy. just do it already, start your fucking life.
