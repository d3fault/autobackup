If I thought two days ago that I'd be entering a formal politician "popularity contest", I wouldn't have believed myself. Or something. I just couldn't see it happening.


I refuse to change a single bit. "constituency" doesn't make any sense. you cannot know what they are thinking 24/7/365 (o wait yes you can (irrelevant)). you can only be yourself and be a good person to the best of your ability. it is just you. you already have to deal with fellow politicians 'passing one by' you, worrying about what your constituents are thinking is too much work.




ROFL I JUST REALIZED I HAVE ALREADY CLAIMED 'D3FAULT' AS A LEGAL ENTITY BY RELEASING 'CLEANTHREADINGEXAMPLE' AND 'OBJECTONTHREADHELPER'

The ICS license I released it under has a "copyright notice" at the top. It is my "persons" now. What I mean is, I can refer to it if I ever need to show "prior use" because someone else tries to jack it. The name change isn't necessary but you might as well. More unified entity. I am d3fault.
