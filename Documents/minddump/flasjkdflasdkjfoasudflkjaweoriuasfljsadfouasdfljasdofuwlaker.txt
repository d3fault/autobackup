maybe if i keep predicting my own assassination over and over and over and over would be assassins will be all like "meh don't want to be predictable!" and not do it. I actually very much doubt that and bet that my assassination... err, the REASON for it... will have nothing to do with anything I say. It will probably be an angle... my stepping on someone's toes as a side effect of some actions.... that trigger their... uhm... pulling of the trigger (lul).
