In any app that "creates" docs, if there's a filename that you save (which actually I've written about and am against [ultimately (it should be an optional tag)]), and you type in a filename that will cause .gitignore (or timestamp-er) to ignore it, well yea the GUI should stop/warn you (mb: Are you sure? [YES] [NO] etc). They should be integrated with one another, like my hacky semi-fail attempt to do so with QuickDirty (hey it worked so it wasn't a complete fail (I just never use it lol))...
