What is the purpose of tears when crying?
I think I've figured it out. They serve no purpose. Tears help us keep our eyes lubricated, which is their evolutionary purpose (if you can see clearly, you can kill/eat better). During crying, they probably accomplish nothing (there might be an evolutionary benefit to "displaying to others that you are crying", however). Crying is an emotional outburst. It's like you have a pocket of emotions in your brain that gets a hole poked in it and the emotions flow out much faster than usual. I'm using the pocket/poke/hole metaphor because it also fits well when describing a pocket of literal tears. Some event triggers the release of those emotions, and that same trigger incidently (or is it coincidentally, I forget) causes the tear pocket to release as well. So it's not that tears during crying provides an evolutionary benefit (although they MIGHT), it's that tears during crying are simply neutral and don't get in the way (else evolution/natural-selection would likely get rid of them). Evolution is just fucking random (and natural selection makes the beneficial features permanent), tears when crying are just fucking random (and natural selection has no reason to eliminate the genetic code that cause tears during crying).
