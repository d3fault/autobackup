i don't know how i got my most recent fwb

i mean
i'm kind of in denial that it even happened

yet, very proud of myself for it


like idk

but the point of this doc isn't that

it's this weird ass feeling i had when waking up from a power nap the day i met her

i was up all night the night before and met her at the pool at around noon

then while texting power nap'd at around 4

my texts on google voice w/e can give you a good frame of reference

i wasn't trying to go to sleep, i was just laying there texting to her

but like the onto the feeling


i was like half asleep

submerged in my dream

and i slowly came out of it (maybe the ringtone did it?)

but like i had the SHITTIEST feeling

like "this is my life? pathetic."

it was before (JUST before) she agreed to have sex with me

i had given up mentally
on her at least
but it was just weird
also i'm going to just use 1 newline from now on lol

or maybe not
idfk.

back to the point:
it was like
surreal
or just god damn fake.
like i was hearing about my story

it was a whoosing feeling
sanity/coherence was flooding back in
but it took like 5-20 seconds
i can't really remember how long

i would compare it to how a person's whole life flashes before their eyes right as they die
except my life didn't flash
it was something else

just like an analysis of the current events
and i felt sick and disgusted
maybe it was the rejection (or what i thought was rejection at the time) that did it

i don't know

but it was weird

like i couuld picture myself on my bed
i even realized at one point during the end that i was 'snapping out of it', right before i did.

i think someday i should analyze how many times i've putten the phrase

i don't know

on it's own line all by itself (regex ^$ shit)

probably tons.
rofl.

but shit

i woke up
and she changed her mind

or something

IDFK.

but now i have a fuck buddy

and even though i'm ashamed of her (:( fat), i still want to keep it

because of my PHYSICAL NEEDS

just watched that house episode where lisa cuddy's mum is in the hospital

PHYSICAL FUCKING NEEDS

not mental
it overrides mental

srsly

makes sense

i just can't fucking help myself...
and to have someone there to fuck is...
...healthy.

better than fucking around.
definitely.

so i want to keep her
she's chill
dumb, but chill.

oh and her tits are a motherfucking 44dd

so fat or not, holy shit i love her tits.

fucked her on the first day

god damn i'm amazing

oh and i told her the truth
i felt good about that

it's a taste of the future

as in..

i tell the truth and they STILL want to have sex with me (but in that future case, it's because i'm rich/d3fault)
