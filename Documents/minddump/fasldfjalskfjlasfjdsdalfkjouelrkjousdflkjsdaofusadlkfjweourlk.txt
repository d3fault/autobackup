In theory there should be zero overlap between theory and practice, but in practice there is a substantial amount.

Err actually "difference" fits better than "overlap". "Zero" becomes "no" in that case as well...


JUST HILARIAL IS ALL


In theory there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is.


THIS ACTUALLY DEFIES THE LAWS OF SCIENCE/PHSYICS/MATHS/ETC. Is is SCIENTIFICALLY incorrect, but.... humanly... correct. We are dumb.


I don't mean it "breaks" laws of physics or whatever... just doesn't seem to make sense.

Like: 1 = 1, unless humans are involved ;-).

Emotion is probably the source of most of it.
