BY-SA is better than BY-SA-NC because you don't need NC really. The SA element of it keeps would-be proprietors away from it to begin with. If they would sell it, it must be BY-SA as well. They also must:
1) Provide attribution
2) Not infringe on your trademark!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


So they cannot "sell it" using your name and take credit for the work. Trademark infringement.
Also, they can't rename it + sell it WITHOUT giving proper attribution (which causes the audience to go towards the creator).



I guess that only really applies if you release shit under a trademark.... but yea you should / can / will (I mean, _I_ will :-P).





I am FOR Trademarks
AGAINST Copyright

Copyright infringement is "distributing works" without permission.
Trademark infringement is claiming to be someone. It's like a step above not properly attributing a works, because it instead takes all credit for all works.




I was thinking about this earlier and stumbled upon a logical contradiction involved with it. Or maybe I didn't but thought there might be one. I forget and I didn't get to a keyboard in time :(.




Still, two different points in this doc~
