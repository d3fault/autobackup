Until launch, I am a theoretical human.


Training a human to be maximally a human is too much responsibility for one (or even 7 billion) humans to do over the course of ~80 years.


Alice in Wonderland is telling about the two halves of the brain. Alice is the creative/emotional side of the brain and is also the point of view (this might be-because/mean that our perception(had:perspeption)/5(lol-had-6-der-movie)-senses must be filtered through the emotional/creative side of our brain before the other analytical side processes it/them, or maybe it's just the more movie-worthy side to show. The other side of the brain, the analytical one, is the do-do bird. He is always trying to make sense out of his immediate surroundings, and none of his actions don't make sense during the exact moment he thinks them up. Perhaps the reason the film shows alice is because the analytical side would make too frantically changing of a plot. He lacks a "birds eye view" (oh shit pun about her being as tall as a bird's nest not intended) that Alice does not. The two interact with each other unaware of what the other really is.

Alice creates her own evil (queen) by exploring indefinitely and never being content. When everything washes away for Alice, we get a glimpse of the do-do bird, spiraling aimlessly and carelessly (one might even say drunkenly) on a floating cork out in (had: in the middle of) an infinite ocean.

I want to watch AiW again, this time focusing more on the do-do bird.
