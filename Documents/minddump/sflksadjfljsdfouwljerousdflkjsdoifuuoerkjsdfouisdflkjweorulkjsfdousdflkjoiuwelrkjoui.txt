Because the christmas tree is larger, "browse" will seem like the default destination. On a longer term (once Christmas tree is removed), the default view (or d3fault view (lololololololol you are too smart for your own good because that does in fact make sense and they both do!... but KISasfuckS)) the default view will be timeline. That is by will alone. I prefer it.
