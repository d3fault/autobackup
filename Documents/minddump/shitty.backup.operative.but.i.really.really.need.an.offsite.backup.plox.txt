new backup mode thingy
i'm going to backup my 750x drives
i'll lose timestamps on my 'autobackup' folder, but not the git log associated.
also the timestamps for regular files in 750x drives are preserved

i want to go on vacation but i am too afraid of leaving my hard drives unattended
i NEED an offsite backup for peace of mind
it's a good idea either way

but my work lately i value more than earlier
even though shit, i value it all
i'd fucking an hero if i lost EVERYTHING
cases where i'd lose everything:
robbed, fire, fbi raid

i need this offsite backup regardless of me going to california for a few days
the thought of leaving my files in my house, ALL of the drives in my room, makes me puke
i should have done this earlier
