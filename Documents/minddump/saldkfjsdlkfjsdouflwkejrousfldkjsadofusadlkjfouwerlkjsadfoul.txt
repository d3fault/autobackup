Just as a child does not ask his parents to be born, life does not ask existence to emerge. It is in that sense, and that sense alone, that life cannot not exist. Because it is only life that can analyze what exists and what does not. A tree falls in the forest and does make sound, but is not heard and therefore not noticed. Life takes billions/trillions/etc of "earth years" to emerge, but there is no life to perceive that period of time and it's therefore not noticed.

You can easily see life as an inescapable jail, but that is a recipe for depression. You have to, through will alone, enjoy life. There are plenty of things to enjoy... at least for me.
