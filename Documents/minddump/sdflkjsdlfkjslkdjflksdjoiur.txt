i will go private again if, after i launch, i am unable to generate so many fucking crazy/trippy vivid dreams and thoughts. i seem to be on a roll lately and i am really worried that after i launch i won't be able to anymore


i still have no idea if i will allow input
if i DON'T, i cannot collaborate via open/libre/free software


if i do, i invite paranoia/shame/etc/etc/etc



gah


it is important to me that i keep myself freely thinking
