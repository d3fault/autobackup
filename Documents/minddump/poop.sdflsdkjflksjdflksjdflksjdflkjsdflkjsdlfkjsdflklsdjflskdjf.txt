Poop is a great word. I'm probably not the first person to think this. I think there's a word to describe it also, maybe sounds like "auto-mata-pee-uh" (ironically also means "sounds like what it is"). The first P goes along well with your sphlincter popping open. The two O's represent the log. The final P your sphlincter slamming shut again. Even the shape of your mouth as you say the word mirrors the shape of your anus as you drop a deuce.
