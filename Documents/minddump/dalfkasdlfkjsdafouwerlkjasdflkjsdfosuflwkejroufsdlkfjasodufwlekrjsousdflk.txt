logic is like a string of metal poles about 12 inches in length taped together to make a flimsy sort of wire
it conducts electricity silently and effectively, with no visual appeal

faith is like a pile of twigs on fire
provides you warmth and something to look at, but is primitive in nature (electricity > fire) and doesn't last as long
