I frequently drift off thinking about how fucking awesome my life is going to be. It's difficult, but I force myself to snap back into now (was tempted to put 'reality' instead of 'now' ;-P) and get back to coding. I am the domina (dominus? which is it?) (dreaming), whipping guy (forcing myself back to work), and the slave (coder). Good combo imo.

Picture Quentis standing up on that balcony with his arms extended bracing himself against the railing, staring off into the clouds (and down below are the other two guys)
