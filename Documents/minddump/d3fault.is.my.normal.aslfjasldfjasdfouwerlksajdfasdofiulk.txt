i was acting like a retard alone by myself pretending i was partying with old tempe friend
joelle, nicole, etz

it was after i had launched, so they had a new perspective of me
but i was intentionally acting dumb
like trolling them
and nicole called me out
"are you just playing dumb? are you recording our reaction?" ( i secretly was [recording] (well and acting))

and i stopped and said:
"yea. ok, i'll go back to being normal... err i mean d3fault, there's no such thing as d3fault"


and that's the whole reason for this doc

i wanted to point that out
everybody has their own flavor of 'normal'
