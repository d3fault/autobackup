In the beginning there was nothing, and over the course of infinite time (?), the nothing glitched and split into two parts: 1 and -1. Then, evolution. It glitched because there was nothing else for it to do. But what glitched? How does nothing'ness glitch?

If the nothing is glitchable, then it must be something. Fuck.
