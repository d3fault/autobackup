d3fault (network) and it's associated library to access the network filesystem, should be LGPL
the reason being is so that companies can use it and promote it's use for free, and possibly even contribute back to it

which brings me to my next point
an application such as a word processing application that isn't run 24/7 should only be used for it's bandwidth
there can be 2 forms of 'trusted'
regular where they're expected to hold files long term
and short-term where the files they are given are only files of high interest and they help spread out the bandwidth
when they go offline and re-emerge, they are not expected to still have the files (though they might as well until they are overwritten)

should it be a cost of using the network? to provide your bandwidth at the very least?
this is not a viable solution for mobile (very expensive bandwidth) users
