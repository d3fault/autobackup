it boils down to: do i want to release previous material that i am both ashamed of and scared of?
should i shred it and release a 100% mode?
hide from it?
it still happened whether documented or not

when reviewing, it is a boolean true or false: should i let myself censor?
does shredding count as censoring?
does keeping encrypted count as censoring?
i would say yes
but i am genuinely scared of it
it might bring death
