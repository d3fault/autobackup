If yes I am in control and yes metaphor/figment/etc and I'm wondering why I can't just will a better situation out of this existence, well I'm wrong: I can. I forget that my brain has a dependency it loves and hates simultaneously: I like to understand shit from the ground up. So here I am, just barely understanding the world as it stands... but I HAVE THE FUCKING POWER to change it and make it better. If the shit was just derp presented to me, I probably (at first I didn't have the word probably here (but the one following was there)) wouldn't understand it and I probably wouldn't accept it (until understood ofc). I'm making myself build it so I will of course understand it.

And of course, admittedly it may all just be delusions of an drugged out motherfucker. I'm 50/50 on the matter. Hilariously, the evidence as to one way or another is hidden oh so perfectly behind the very same thing that evil/corruption hides behind: ambiguity.


I ask myself over and over "this is something, but where did this something come from?". I realize now that any answer that has the ability to make sense must itself be a something. So if this something came from something, where did that something come from? The parent of the something always must come from something IN ORDER FOR IT TO MAKE SENSE IN MY BRAIN. Therefore, I'm missing a piece of the puzzle (or something ;-P) and it is unsolvable (either for now or forever).
