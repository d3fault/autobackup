i think it will prove to be much more difficult than i am assuming to (music + dance) and code at the same time


it will be more like my subconscious processing each

while coding i can listen to old music and/or add to it at any point i want

but while making music i probably will not be actively coding: only my subconscious will be processing something

very doubtful that i'll do both actively simultaneously


still, the interface and being able to switch back and forth instantly is what i desire

dance + code yes
but make music + code?? good fucking luck hahaaha


unless each keystroke / statement makes a sound and somehow the random organization of sounds that is code actually sounds good
doubtful but hypothetically possible


i fantacize of music having the answer

if the music sounds good, the design is right

i also fantacize about the same being true for politics

law making etc

"that law doesn't SOUND good"

music cannot lie

EXCEPT I'M DEAD WRONG

politicians would use the music to insert red herrings etc
bastards have no rules or morals

this idea sucks but is still worth exploring

and for the coding it would have less of a chance of being corruptable (though still very much a chance, especially if code and law merge (lol wut brain just asploded but i mean yea it's a goal))
