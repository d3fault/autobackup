i am tired of sitting in silence (loner coder)
but i don't want to compete for attention (hollywood, irl socializing, etc)

watching that vid yesterday made me lol so fucking hard
her dad owns a bank
probably pulled massive fucking strings
...so she could touch steven tyler's arm in a music video

ROFL

her 'entry into hollywood'
or whatever

fucking pathetic
makes me sick

hollywood is disgusting
so many people desparate for attention that just have the life sucked right out of them

they tend to be worthless anyways
just want to be on tv for the sake of being on tv

attention whores




i won't compete

i'm building my own platform

and i don't care about my viewer count

i feel like i'm getting way to into this

automating the advertising platform

which is no becoming automating remote server communciation


i'm too fucking smart for my own good

i can code myself into a tangent and live there for the rest of my life

i need to CLOSE FUCKING PARENTHESIS
and launch.


this reminds me of a thought i was having
i may have even written about it
i forget lol.


anyways

a brain can never stop learning
err, until it dies
but until then you can fill it with knowledge

some will be forgotten

but all the knowledge clashes and combines to make up who you are


if you work at dominos for your entire life

you will have a fucking pHd in 'apartment complex layouts'



so fucking sick

this world is so fucking stupid


JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE SMART DOES NOT MEAN YOUR INTELLIGENCE IS WORTHWHILE

einstein could be a delivery driver

and he could memorize every apartment complex in an entire city

and then die
and he'd have been worthless.



pick a letter of the alphabet

flip to a random page in the dictionary for that alphabet

grab a dart, throw it at the dictionary


take that word and study it

you will never be able to finish studying that word until you die


every piece of knowledge has infinite sub-tangent/sub-knowledges

you can learn ANYTHING indefinitely

you can easily waste your life away~


i'm glad i have a legitimate focus.
e = mc^2 is the result of einstein's work

a life of dedication for a tiny ass equation (i mean sure he prolly did other shit.. but stfu)


my life will boil down to the very same

as will others'



but some will have a blank sentence
an empty line
'the doomed'


FUCK THE DOOMED

yet

pity them?
help them!


they are our future
we need to systematically reduce idiocy

we need to improve school
not through school
through the internet

etc


my parents are blank lines
and that makes me want to cry

my dad is a walking fucking sports almanac

my mom raised a family

an accomplishment...... yet also NOT
it's like 'going with the flow' type accomplishment

i love her :(



my dad's sports almanac'ness is equivalent to the delivery driver being a master of apartment complex layouts: FUCKING WORTHLESS


idk i woke up this morning
err i guess tonight
like 5pm but w/e
thinking: i am a man and so is my father
what i mean is like
i need to stop depending on him for starters
and idk
his accomplishments are accomplishments to him
and mine are to me
this doesn't sound nearly as organized as it did in my thoughts (as don't most)





i've got a great head start on montaigne
because i'm so young
and because of the technology i am presented with
and because of the technology i will build.

guy's a fucking legend
but i'll shit him out for breakfast. wait no this doesn't make any sense /happy-gilmore


he was old + retired when he started
i started young + pre-retired
pre-starting

i found what i wanted to do IN my writing
during
now i want to document and continue to write
WHILE I DO IT
and then there's my olden days
when i'm old as fuck (and therefore allowed to use bullshit words like 'wisdom')
maybe i'll discredit myself at this age etc (HEY OLDER STEVEN: FUUUUUCK YOUUUUUUUU :-P)



i'm so god damn leaky

just a couple days ago i did:

echo "127.0.0.1 boards.4chan.org" >> /etc/hosts
and
echo "127.0.0.1 actually i foget lmfao"

but yea i mean i'm trying to systematically reduce input and output
to force myself into coding/launching
giving myself the squeeze
i also disabled my facebook


it's getting more boring
and i find myself lowering my standards for movies i want to watch

but i'd rather watch old movies than introduce new input or produce output prematurely

i need to stfu.

and i need to cut off input
fucking brainwash everywhere

even if it isn't, it feels like it is, so it's just as bad
fuck you bill o'reilly
fuckin parents blasting fox news 24/7

i want to kill myself
i need to get out of here before i do
i need to launch before it happens

life can be 'sweet' (portishead)

i also don't listen to last.fm radio
i'll still scrobble
but fuck listening to it

the last song i listened to was like "i know you're afraid yada yada you walk around with your head down" and i'm just like FUCK THIS SHIT I DON'T WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS GARBAGE ANYMORE

no more *new* music :(...
....but fuck it
i need to dupe/better last.fm anyways

BY-SA or bust
gtfo.

and none of this changing in realtime shit either
fuckin songs change every other day
pisses me off


definitely losing my mind

i don't even think i could go back at this point

i'm so committed.


the only thing i think is relatively secure is this typing on the computer


not my recording devices (flash media can't shred)
not my friends
not my cellphone (ROFL)
not watching TV
not watching movies

i can only securely*: output into my devbox
there is no input from it
unless you count reflection (i don't)

i need to be ok with that
i need to toughen up
get IN THE ZONE
stay there
until launch
then COLD MOTHERFUCKING TURKEY all of the sudden you can say whatever you want and live free and baw fuck all
i'd even be willing to take brainwash input at that point because i could point out as watching it: this is brainwash
but then again my LIBRE-OR-BUST rules will probably not allow that
i'll miss shit
surely
but, it's worth it.

build a new collection of knowledge
fuck you hollywood
fuck you corporatism
fuck you <current> government (owned by the previous two)

libre or bust
i don't want proprietary knowledge to enter my brain
i'll miss my old music especially
the offspring
etc

maybe certain groups will join me
but i can't be fucked if they don't
fuck them
sellouts
greedy
humans




THAT I CAN gives me hope
that i am not yet there depresses the fuck out of me
born too soon etc

but this is my life
this is my e=mc^2

SOMEONE HAS TO

i bet einstein wished he could benefit from maths hundreds of years from when he was born
i bet he had some pretty cool visions too
probably much different than mine (i'm actually willing to bet mine are better: fuck yea software/robotz)


this is my *insert cheesy hollywood line*: weight, task, mission, etc

SHARE THE LOAD FRODO
fuck you samwise/hollywood

you just want to profit from my knowledge on the short term

hollywood's solution to EVERYTHING: make a movie about it
-_-

idiots.


awareness is ONE thing
but it does not solve problems
it doesn't even begin

take steps to begin

vs.

write about it to PROFIT
fucking faggots.



ahh yea the word i was looking for: this is my burden
:-P

cheesy cheesy cheesy


i hope to flale about so randomly
say so fucking much
that nobody takes anything i say seriously
so i can just be left alone to flale about and spout randomly
fuck you all i can be content by myself

if that's true why do you want to launch?

OH RIGHT BECAUSE I CAN'T ___SPEAK___ without feeling like i'm being spied on / ripped off
and i know it's probably true

so i HAVE TO claim it as a copyright
it is a self defense

fuck communication
but also fuck getting ripped off.


god i hate this fucking world we live in
i will change it
i will change it or i will die trying (or give up and kill myself -- same thing)
that is my 'burden'
