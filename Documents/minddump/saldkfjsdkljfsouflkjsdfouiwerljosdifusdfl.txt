I feel like my sanity is racing against a supercomputer with priority X of decrypting my already stolen content. It might also be my entire integrity as once they crack it, they can permanently steal and/or overwrite-precisely (overwriting encrypted blurbs of random is impossible to poinpoint a single file for example) files without my ever knowing. I am in an extremely vulnerable state and I'm just sitting here smoking bowls. I need to use safer and more overloaded methods to help me escape this paranoia. This does not depend on my launching, though I will attempt to solve it again/better live. I should note that the solving attempt is d3fault dream dht. Indendent Global Backup Solution. The independent wording is not to be confused with "indy" [music,etc]... but is a technical requirement meaning a single node in the network can act fully on it's own (offline, where the software then instructs you on when to add nodes to your [cluster] and/or drives to your boxes (depending on future of computing and/or era)). I have the right to create IGBS in pursuit of sanity/happiness. Copyleft is the tool to ensure sharing and sharing happens to be a requirement of it sustaining itself. How can you make a copy of something you don't have the right to make a copy of?

Revolution Releases will make me lol but will ultimately be a hinderence because then my Timeline gets screwed up by having a null reference (I have to be DMCA compliant or else I will be raided).

IGBS will be delete-proof as a requirement for sanity.
The government will force me to not be delete-proof in my business design (I guess an intermediary backup solution using business DHT (couchbase)?), which is utter bullshit. Despite it being utter bullshit and easily exploitable for corruption, censorship, and other forms of pure evil, it is reality in 2013 and NOT complying will result in raid. The copyright industry owns the world.
