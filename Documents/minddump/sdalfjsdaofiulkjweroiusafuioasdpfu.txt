half and half, fuck it
coding (public, open source) i remain calm and silent
otherwise i am jammin dancing tripping privately headbanging etc, letting myself go
i maintain a steady balance between the two
doesn't have to be 50/50
10/90
30/70
whatever
i could even have a 3rd... (socializing with others?)
do whatever you want man, there are no rules


i do wish kaylee would respond to me
i want to figure out where she fits in this whole thing
probably nowhere :(
pessimism says i scurred her
optimism says she's breaking up with eddie and then going to respond
both are realities (infinite multiverse chaos theory), but which one is real for mine?

aren't they both real?
like, as of now, neither are real

the cat is in the box and it is both dead and alive
until i open the box

so i can not open the box and never find out
or open it and confirm that it is dead
that's what i want though, is confirmation

i'm okay with her rejection
i've been over this
wondering is what's eating me away...
but man would it be so fucking awesome if she said yes (to any of it)
companionship is the main goal
a child is optional
