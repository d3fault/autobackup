How do I tell the future to come back in time to get me. Such time travel is only possible through big bang resets, and there are no surviving those. Forward time travel is ridiculously easy with ice. For what it accomplishes, it is a very low cost. Wormholes (theoretically though I doubt we'll ever find one because they'd be so rare (the wording "so rare" does not make sense when relating to infinty)) aside, we cannot go back in time. Actually fuck wormholes too they're bullshit. It matters not. It is true regardless of whether or not we can go backwards that we can go forwards.
