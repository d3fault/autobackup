Stupity, and the fear of looking stupid, are both individual enemies (easily confused with one another). An intelligent man making progress still occassionally (read:often) does/says something stupid. OT: A stupid man almost always does/says stupid things, but can occassionally/accidentally do/say something smart (it's in the same way that chaos/evolution, via natural selection, evolves intelligence (BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF TRIAL + ERROR)).
