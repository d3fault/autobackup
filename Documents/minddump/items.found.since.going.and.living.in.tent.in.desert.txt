horizontal grill (my small circular one couldn't reach across my fire ring)
frying pan with folding handle (when i cooked with it, the results looked... rusty... so I don't use it anymore)
over 9000 gloves. so many i've stopped collecting them
2 working lighters with decent amounts of fluid in them
5 bungie cords (one of which i pulled out from under a rock in the middle of a river while hunting crawdads)
what looks like a slide out cutting board (but might be a drawer), which I'm using as a hanging-from-tree desk this very moment (i have a ghetto rigged "laptop": hook & loop afixed computer components sitting on the desk)
a well made beer bong
a particularly "speedy" knife sharpener
~6 ft of thick'ish rock climbing-esq rope
shoe lace
a wooden and engraved practice katana
name brand slingshot with foldout wrist brace
3 sunglasses
"minimalist" knife and sheath (has 3 finger grip handle and the blade itself is no more than an inch)
non-matching (brandwise. it's left + right tho) decent quality sandals. better than the cheapo thongs i brought out here. found them right next to each other
snorkel
belt
