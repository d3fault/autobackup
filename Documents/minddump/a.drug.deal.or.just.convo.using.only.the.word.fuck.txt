might have already written about this before

a conversation consisting only of the word 'fuck'

there are so many tones/usages it isn't even funny

you can ask a question

say yes or no

etc
so easily
it's ridiculous.
but it would take a semi-intelligent person

i imagine a drug deal. you specify the drug you want based on just the way you use the word fuck

you deal with brown bags. everything is recorded live. nobody can tell/prove what you are talking about
