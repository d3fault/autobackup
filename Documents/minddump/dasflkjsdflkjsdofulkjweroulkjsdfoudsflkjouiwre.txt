I'm so insecure (both technologically and physically (both computer and my persons)) it's laughable. I could hack and kill myself with ease, therefore I know others can as well.

I guess I'll just continue forward like this (famous last words), hoping I'm still "under the radar" [enough (too loud on Qt mailing lists etc dumbass)] for anyone to give a shit about me :-D.

I do like knowing that I can still be fulfilled and happy if I were to lose all these docs (brain/self is most important)... but the thought of that still does bring me a huge depression.
