If you're going to wager a bet with chaos, bet all your money on the fibbonacci sequence. There is evidence of it's winnings all around us in nature.

Despite being a beautifully crafted statement, I can't think of any applications/uses of it. I could rename Abc to GoldenBitcoin and use the fibbonacci sequence instead of doubling (doubling might go 'too high' and might be less profitable... but really I think it would probably end up close to the same either way. Just with doubling I'll have less days in the future sold at any given point) for the rate of increase per day, but bleh I don't think that's really taking advantage of it in any kind of beneficial way like nature somehow does. I wish I understood physics/chemistry/whatever better so that I can understand the relationship between Fibonnacci and Nature. I mean I get it from a high level perspective, but I wish I knew WHY (maybe nobody does, but I'd imagine some do?).
