Man I fucking crack up whenever I look at my fundraiser page. So.... fucking.... stupid... (mission accomplished). I envy the 3rd person perspective. I am biased and can't see just how stupid I look :(. I mean I can see it quantifiably (pretty fucking stupid), but I don't have the.... experience... to go along with it. Their lacking so much information warps the fuck out of their experience, and I am jealous (lulz must have ensued (even if AT me, I am _still_ jealous)).
