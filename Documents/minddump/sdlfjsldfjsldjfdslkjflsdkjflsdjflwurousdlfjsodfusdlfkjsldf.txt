We start off the same (1) and then through our DNA we are uniquie'ified, and then through our experiences we are unique'ified again. We are unique through [dont-have-a-word-for-it] so many times that we do indeed feel (tempted-to-put:so) vectorifically (tm) unique that we begin to kill each other as enemies and/or PEERS (though we are still the same (1)). In fact, we eat each other to survive.
