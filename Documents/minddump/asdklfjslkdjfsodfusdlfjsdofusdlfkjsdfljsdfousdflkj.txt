Living emotionally/impulsively is both good and bad. It's good because riding your emotion is the only way to truly enjoy being human. It's bad because sometimes your impulses are unhealthy (*cough*). I stumbled into that cognitive dissonance and laughed really hard when I understood it. On one hand I'm telling myself to live emotionally/impulsively, and on the other I am telling myself not to. I laughed and concluded that it is solved really only one way (for me): launch. Launch forces me to not allow myself to be unhealthy. Right here and now (pre-launch), I can't think of a [different] solution to it (aside from the obvious one (self control) that isn't working lawl)...
