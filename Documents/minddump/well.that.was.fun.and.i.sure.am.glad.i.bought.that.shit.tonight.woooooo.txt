this is my test arduino fingers document
i will type in here while playing blops and just spam it with whatever. no seeing what i type.ok uh what was i saying omg this is badass i hope i actually do it. the 3 in d3fault is to remind you that there is no such thing as a perfect default. everything is a person's personal opinion of what that default should be. all of mine are going to live under the d3fault poject/namespace. i am a personalization of what i think a human should be. i do not seek any power above my fellow man.. just found a bug i died above the tank in the water which my TI was under and then i spawned on top of the tank.... i get off on writing code.. the pieces of data i will collect are as follows: each keystroke, obviously. and my average keystroke per second for the given sentence/segment (judged by when PAUSED). that average + the start + the end timings, is a good MINIMUM amount of data without having TOO MUCH "timestamp" overhead. "they wrote this segment between this time and this was their average kpm". the arduino will translate my slider positions to determine letters (etc0) and the raspberrypi write it via a Qt app encryptedly to SSD. later, said SSD can be plugged into a "live" computer for foreverfilesystem synchronization. the same features are available offline as online... you just sync up later if you choose (and with air gap of course). for games, every keystroke and timestamp is saved because that is what is needed to replay the game. re-render it so to speak.. i think i want to save the time i do an action and the 0-1024 value of the slider. every single one. then i can retanslate each one later.... replay with different input processing.
like typing for shit, then replay the typing as music for fuck why not any reason because you can
