We exist in the added meaningless (negated) computation for a ridiculously complex unsimplified value of 1. That is, if we simplified and reduced and all that math away, all you'd have left is the number 1.

The thought first came without being "in the negated computation". We are the.... redundant/negated factors themselves. BUT I think it sounds... righter... that we exist in the EXTRA computation. Either might be right, and I have no idea if this is even a metaphor or true. JUST SOUNDS GOOD YA'KNOW LOL BUY MY BOOK PLZ KTHX.



ex: ((((1)+3)-4)+(5-4))
=
1




I suppose/guess the computation itself is...... chemical reaction?
Or maybe it being our skewed magnifying glass of "emotion" fits better?
Fuck it
