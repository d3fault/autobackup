a) So fragile it makes me want to puke
b) That I/we still exist, given (a), serves as [weak] proof/eviDance of infinite multiverse theory


Of course my peers are [still] ass-shit afraid. If they were as....... (derp with your derps here).... free.... as me..... I'd see tons of them dropping dead everywhere I looked. "Harnessing"/"Embracing" IMT can only be done by one person, to himself. It can't be shared, nobody can join me up here (so out-logic the feeling of loneliness (if only it were that ez)). I already knew this (came up with it while designing the PRNG 1/100 suicide machine), but forgot.


^Squeezes out the logic: the only way to not be lonely (had:alone), is to be afraid.
