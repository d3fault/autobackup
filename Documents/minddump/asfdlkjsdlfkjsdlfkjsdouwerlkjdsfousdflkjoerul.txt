I have mentioned before that "Qt will always be my LGPL dependency", but that is actually not NECESSARILY true. I may be able to convince Digia to release Qt under DPL [additionally]. It is of no loss to them as no additional permissions are granted. They could not release under DPL-ONLY and comply with the KDE Free Qt Foundation agreement (saying GPL-compatible must be released), but they could do DPL/LGPL/GPL/Commercial just fine.

The only large benefit I can see from this is the "DPL-Only (BSD using) Stack/Distribution"..... but then there's still the problem of LibAV/FFMPEG still being LGPL only, and they are not in the same position as Digia to even offer me the DPL editions :(. Fork/rewrite? Could incorporate tons of "BSD" codecs already... but eh fucking waste of time and effort tbh, low level video shit isn't interesting [to me to DEVELOP. It is very interesting for me TO USE [as a lib], however. Might be because I suck at it :-P].
