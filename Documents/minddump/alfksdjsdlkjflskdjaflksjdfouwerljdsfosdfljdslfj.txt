drunk:
the story that i wish to tell
the movie that i wish to make
my 'masterpiece'

is the live documentation of the kim dotcom raid

we read about it
stories
from both sides

but to CAPTURE _EVERYTHING_
is priceless

perhaps i should go 'undercover'
'in the shadows'

bait the motherfuckers


once i detect helicopter inbound (the raid)

PUBLISH THE KEY REQUIRED TO VIEW ALL OF IT
all of it

minddump
verbatim
etc


everything up to the raid



then i just sit in silence
wait for the world to... parse the data....
wait for them to overthrow my ruling
exonerate
revolution
whatever word you want to use



idk
i got a lot of ideas
random directions
wat do

DANCE MOTHAFUCKA DANCE
