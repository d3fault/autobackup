Dude, not only is the planet at an exponential increase in knowledge... but YOU ARE TOO. Lately your shit has been getting amazing. You owe it to your fellow man to launch (except also fuck them because "obvious" tangents need to be explored at each plateau? this is tough for me to answer and I really fucking hate patents because of it. Essentially: the existence of a patent system makes a free culture/society infeasible). I'm an exponential on an exponential and I'm all alone in my room typing frantically into this computer. Feels good man (but also bad simultaneously (if you have read up to here, YOU KNOW WHY)).

I mean, I mean... what I was writing a few months ago was good shit.... but what I've been writing this past month is SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE BETTER.

I feel relaxed and confident. I feel sane. I feel alive. I feel great.... despite knowing I'll feel an order of magnitude greater once I've launched.

I've been shaking and squirming (the enjoyable kind) in my bed listening to music some of these past few nights (though why, I will not write here on this box that is/could-be/probably-is compromised ;-)).

I've attained "the state of mind" on a permanent basis now. It is legitimate. I don't NEED drugs (never did really (but I don't NEED them to get to that state of mind anymore)), but I still want them :-P (WHAT MORE CAN I LEARN!?!?!?!?).

I'm ready for launch. I'm accepting it. I'm so fucking close. I'm (lol retarded statement because is always true) closer than I've ever been before ;-). Just a few trivial tasks stand in between me and it. KISS.

Yes I am an arrogant fuck.
