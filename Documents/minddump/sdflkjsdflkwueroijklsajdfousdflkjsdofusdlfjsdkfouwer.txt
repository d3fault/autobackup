Imagine a ball of arms and legs spinning around in every direction so fast you can't see the center object. It would be all cartoon-like and shit (cloudy/dusty). Imagine it hopping up and down. The brief moment it touches the ground you see a single leg meeting the ground perfectly and it jumping back up into the air. You can tell by the fact that it's spinning so frantically that it requires very little energy/effort for it to bounce itself back up into the air.

That's me. That's what I want to be doing, both metaphorically and realistically.


I am a being emerged on a rock, and there's nothing else to do so I dance. Feels good man.
