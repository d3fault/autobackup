Physically, I am close to launch. Philosophically... I've never been further (ok liez, when I was 0 I was dumb and obviously further (but I still feel like I've taken steps back from where I was months ago)). The license is the heart of it. What I do with respect to patents is a big part of it. Those two decisions will be the railings which will guide me forward for my whole (or most of my) life. Since my life affects others, and possibly including whether or not life on earth continues to exist, it's a pretty big deal.

Saying to myself "choose what is smartest" is easy... but actually choosing that smartest thing is ridiculously hard (near impossible, because it IS trying to find a "balance" point that is so rare). Capitalize for money for power for change, vs, be (emulated) free like that changed reality should be. The goals are the same, but the means are opposite/contradictory. Fuck. I am to find a "balance"? Good fucking luck. I should just hook a PRNG up to my brain, I'd have better luck that way ;-P.
