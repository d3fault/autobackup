Couchbase buys me scalability, nothing more. It's as durable as a single database on a single machine with a single hard drive (HMMM I WONDER IF RAID WOULD ACTUALLY SAVE THE DAY HERE!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! (feel incredibly stupid right now, BUT if it does actually do what i think it does/should/claims, then YES IT FUCKING DOES!!!!!! (assuming only the hdd breaks and it isn't a power supply failure (the two most likely) (is there such thing as power supply raid? *searches*))))
