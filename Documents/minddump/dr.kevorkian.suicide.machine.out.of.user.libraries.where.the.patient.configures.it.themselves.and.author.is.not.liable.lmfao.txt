self defense machine

an arm with a gun attached where a patient in bed can aim it and shoot it
does a bed-ridden individual not have the right to bare arms in self defense?

they then aim it at themselves and blamo


ALSO
my first idea that led to that was more along the lines of software
give them a set of tools
a set of... libraries... to allow them to commit suicide

i envisioned that MIT "scratch" thing :-P

but yea i mean modern software licenses (even free) have like warranty and those blame disclaimer thingy-ma-jigs (author is not liable yada yada)

so if they build, using your "software" (which may or may not include a gun on an arm? there are other solutions too of course), a suicide machine. you are not liable!!!!

this will hold up because the entire copyright system is based on that legal text


...and we all know hollywood would rather a billion trillion million gajillion people die than to let their copyright legal text be overturned :-P



but i mean, dr. kevorkian's suicide machine was essentially the same thing
my brain just started pondering the software side of things :-P (and since software is involved, software licenses become involved. they might protect you more than a pure-hardware suicide machine would (unless it too contained legal text like that))


the biggest challenge by far is vegetables :-/
or even awake + can't-move victims




BUT, i don't want to dedicate my life to that
it's an interesting subject but i'm not going to go all apeshit obsessed on it like dr. kevorkian

i am especially not willing to serve time for it
