Difficult to analyze. I've packed together a lifetime of work into a cannon and am trying to determine whether or not to pull the string. There are thousands of unrelated ideas. Tons of things written in anger, some in sadness, others in bliss. It's difficult if not impossible to analyze them all TOGETHER like that. As I'm analyzing, I break off pieces and analyze them one at a time. WHATEVER PIECE[S] I BREAK OFF THAT DAY DETERMINES MY OUTLOOK FOR THE LAUNCH FOR THAT DAY. I could trick myself into launching by focusing solely on the good, or vice versa. I could do a slow/incremental launch (also can't do book that way), but what a fucking waste of time that would be. I want all this to be behind me so I can fucking START various other projects I've had on hold for far too long.
