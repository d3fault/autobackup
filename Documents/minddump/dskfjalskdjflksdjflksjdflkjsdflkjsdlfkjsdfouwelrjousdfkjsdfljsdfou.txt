Apathy is the key, but for all the wrong (right?) reasons

Being, or more accurately: trying to be, apathetic, helped me (even though I had no clue at the time) focus on my 0.00001% self.

Trying to be apathetic only showed me that apathy is impossible. There are some things, such as yourself, that you can never be apathetic about.

HOWEVER, being apathetic about "tons of other bullshit" is proving to be a very good thing! There are just too many things in our environment that are just a complete fucking waste of effort/energy to care about. Ex: My mom gets mad that I use a buffer to clean my dishes (I let the water do all the hard work by letting it soak). Who the fuck cares about dishes? Oh right, my mom.

Apathy about everything except that which truly matters. That which matters is highly subjective (anything you aren't apathetic about, matters (HAH)). This takes analysis and fuck man, peer review would probably help a lot of these dimwits. Life itself and not much else. Your time alive is finite, so spend your care wisely!

For me, being apathetic (and of course, getting into drugs) helped me "disconnect with my snapshot of human knowledge" and realize who/what I am (nobody/nothing (at least ego-wise))... and what I want to be/do (flale).

I say environment is "distracting" etc etc.... but it's several orders of magnitude MORE distracting when you care about random insignificant features of it (a cereal bowl on the counter, for instance).
