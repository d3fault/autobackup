i wanted to take a screenshot sync.png of the left. even saw a face in the code. the top two most "master -> master". lol anyways then later I wanted to remove everything below the mounting but above /home/d3fault, but in between put "omitting git commit" since after all those details are boring (I mean not long term but just for the screenshot (wait lol wtf?)).

the top two masters are my eyes.
man this doc is getting confusing to try to write.

now i remember some more
i also wanted to cut out everything from the RpcGenerator3 thunar session being "done" and up. err no i mean above that. the last mention of RpcGenerator3 stays in, it is part of the sync. man i'm so off track from the original thought which i am still trying to describe (think of)

more of the original(mb): but then now i'm writing this doc and like idfk

something above the sizes of 
*about the sizes of the document and the operating system. as i was resizing+moving this doc, hmm now that i think about it i forget.
