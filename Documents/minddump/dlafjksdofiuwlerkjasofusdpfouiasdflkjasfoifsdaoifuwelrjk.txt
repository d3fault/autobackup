kaylee is making me lose my mind
i change my mood every time i see her
somedays i feel up because she plays flirty games with me
somedays i feel destroyed because we just don't talk much... or she doesn't answer my texts or something stupid
she's blown me off on several hangouts
so i went over to grandma's today with the mindset: 'fuck it, i just wont bring it up again and that will be that'
but then she asks: 'so how bout that hike?' and winks at me
lol i'm just like "ehh what about it? you're all talk" (lololol)
and i mean she was just generally flirtier (might have been because her boyfriend wasn't here)
she verbalized our body language communication
we're always eye-fucking the shit out of each other
i love her
i want to show her this document
i want to share my life with her
i also want to go public
but i feel i could share more with her than with anyone
then again, i don't know many people
but those i do know, don't even compare

still, i could even see her using the line "you just need to get yourself out there"
hell, i'll even admit that it might be true
maybe i'm just in love with the idea of her
maybe i am genuinely in love with her, but i don't know her (also could be true), and once i get to know her then meh.
or more likely once she gets to know me ;-)
but idk
she seems semi-batshit
maybe should could handle it all just fine

maybe she'd be ok with 'secrets'
like keeping a 'diary' and respecting each other's privacy
my computer contents will be my 'diary'

but idk, i personally hate secrets
i don't want to keep any and i don't want any held from me
a perfect life would be 100% truth
and being 100% yourself

>>i personally
as if there's a difference
ahh fuck it
mood swings suck
wondering sucks
i can handle rejection
i would EMBRACE and CHERRISH acceptance
