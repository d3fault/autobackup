I think I could tackle and defeat my father's insanity. I think I should. This after watching "This boy's life". I don't feel obligated to, but I want to. He is my father.

What do I want? Cheesy as it sounds, I want him to be as happy as me. He's got a brilliant mathematical mind but it's contained in a small sad little box ("religion"). Makes me want to cry even just writing this...
