yOu know how i said i can't figure out a solution to the "man making movies getting money so he can continue making movies" problem?

well i figured out why it's unanswerable. it has to do with the whole macro resources problem. just as there's no viable long term solution to "free market" and capitalism, there's no answer to the copyright industry's... 'methods'.



Copyright is used as in incentive to create artistic works...
...it uses MONEY to provide incentive


We need a COMPLETELY NEW MODEL. The incentive to create artistic works should be enjoyment, not money. Money is a logical trap. It was inevitable that we'd stumble into it. Getting out of it is going to be ridiculously hard. So many stubborn greedy idiots out there...



P2P "resources" (food, shelter, EASY) and then public domain everything............. watch what art comes from that, I guarantee you it'll be an order of magnitude better... and there'll be an order of magnitude more of it too.



Also it basically solves human depression overnight (not really, but would certainly help a lot....). Born -> Work -> Die


Or: Born -> LIVE -> Die




Take your pick, idiots.
