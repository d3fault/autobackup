i am not afraid [anymore]
i would say that prior to today or the past few days, i was referring to "those with a name" etc as being adults. excluding myself from the populace. i am in fact an adult. sure i am a young adult, but i am definitely not a child any longer. being a kid sucked. ignorance is bliss, sure... but freeeeeeeeeedom = bliss


kids are not free
we should change that


every human (no matter what age) should be free
the only law: do no harm
everything else is derived from it
"copyright infringement" is actually ARGUABLE harmful
it is... lessining profits
but it is not directly and explicitly harm
you take away from them SOME profits
they will still make some
but not as much as they would have made if you also paid?


freedom of information is more important though
fuck off and die.
