I must give OSiOS (and really, all my work) to the public. Auto-farming (etc) technology especially deserves to be monopolized by the government.

I added (etc) in afterwards, but it kinda kills the emphasis on especially xD.

If auto-farming (etc) technology becomes owned by co-conspiring large US&A companies that are perfectly legal today ("business deals"), we would be fucked.

OSiOS achieves the highest level of security I have seen. It of course depends entirely on no network access and no physical access. No 3rd party I mean ofc (I keep dat shit in my pocket (etc (backpack would maybe suffice)))

I could 
I was going to say I could achieve OSiOS faster
but maybe I could achieve auto-farming faster, I"ve never attempted
It may be that they are comparable. Perhaps both are "large projects". Choose wisely.

OSiOS is definitely more interesting.
Auto-farming the more necessary.

Do I live for myself or the people?

Do I shoot myself in the foot by saying that?

Now I have to choose something, and one will resemble the other.

Auto-farming technology especially deserves to be coded online. That is to say, in a launched/public state. It's worth mentioning that I am also allowed to code OSiOS before auto-farming [when in a launched/public state].


I don't want to feel like I'm falling down and a jester to the general public. I mean shit Abc2 solves this but srsly wtf am I doing sitting here when I could be out skipping and dancing in front of some queen at a fancy dinner that all of her nobility friends are attending. I want to be stable and free to explore code. This money tangent is really getting on my nerves.

I don't want to feel like I'm falling down towards death and that I am forced into being a jester for the general public. I probably meant to write it like that the first time. Fuggit.
