I need (for sanity (which is life)) my hard drive to be an index of information entered into and/or exitted from my brain. Deleting such entries fucks-with (ruins) my design for sanity. The sanity requirement/target of the project is defeated the moment I remove one entry from my brain/hard-drive.

As a computer programmer, my hard drive quite literally is an extension of my brain. I am claiming that to be true, therefore it is (unless you can prove it false ofc gl;hf).
^The sentence is stronger (and does that mean more accurate? I guess yes) without "quite literally". I think the comma would also become a semi-colon too.
