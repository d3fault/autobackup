computer programming vague
ahh yes where was i,
basically all anyone knows is that i do computer programming
it's such a large field that my family literally doesn't understand it
i need to output one fucking thing to show them
the only thing i've shown them is remaxexcel
LOL.
thousand bucks for that piece of shit
so sloppy so hacky so headache so fuck that shit
coding at my own pace is the best coding experience and therefore potential and also use of life
retaining creative control is also a large incentive

i kinda feel bad for them
at least my immediate parents
they wonder
dey gots no clue lawl
they don't understand programming :(
but they can look at a gui/app and be all like 'uhh ok so y ou made dat cool gj son now where is my money'
