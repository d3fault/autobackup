Perception is the 6th sense. Your 5 senses all funnel together and go through your conscience (the chaotic smashing of those 5 senses causes the conscience to emerge in the earlier stages of evolution), and then the end result is your perception. It isn't any one of the senses nor is it ONLY a combination of the 5 of them.

Senses are essntially reactors. Reaction to the environment. Hmm maybe with less emphasis on the ACTION portion of reaction. And yet, receptor seems like it's missing some vital element.


Data input channels

Whether or not the computer utilizes the data input channels is a matter of how evolved it is. You mux the data input channels together and feed it through a weird historical analysis (and reflection) module (that coincidentally emerged from the chaotic "pounding" of those data input channels onto... your... brain tissue (in earlier stages), until a basis OS from zeros and ones came about by dumb luck) that is your conscience and your THOUGHT (perception) for a given... "event" (which can have multiple "perspectives" (you see something and hear it simultaneously, etc))... is a "sense" on it's own. It is the most advanced and complex (we have them, but we do not understand them [fully yet]) sense known to us, and because of it's complexity it is often not regarded as a sense. I disagree.

Senses are data input channels from environment.
Thoughts arise from [ultimately] data input channels from the environment. (Thoughts are the result of perception ofc)
