My sister will forever and always be trying to get back to her freedom/partying days before having a child (she went pretty wild (hence the child))... just as a poor person spends their entire life trying to get rich.

Having a goal makes you lose perspective... and lots of times you spend your entire life trying to reach it. My goal right now is to free up ALL of my time. So basically my goal is to not have any goals. That way I can set entirely arbitrary ones and pursue them purely for pleasure.
