there is pretty much NO WAY IN HELL i will ever be poor
if i run out of ideas for making money, i can just read back at all of my ideas
i have too many to implement in a single lifetime
OR MAYBE NOT (IF I OUTSOURCE PROPERLY/EFFICIENTLY)
hmm you know that is right tbh the smart person uses his resources efficiently
very efficiently
if i could build such a system (i could), i probably COULD implement every idea
at least my software ones
WAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY TOOOO MUUUUUCHHH for one person...
.....but definitely doable by an army of outsourced coders

from their perspective, it should look like they are working with a company
i hire people to take my [requirements] or whatever for an app and put them into a 'we would like to hire you to work on this product [x] feature [y]' and shit. they are like the HR people. it is a specialized/invented(?) role
meh actually fuck that
they should know they are doing it for/with/at d3fault
me
not 'us'
me
yay look at me i'm so shiny
in the spotlight all alone up here and hogging the attention
LOOK AT ME LOOK WHAT I MADE ALL BY MYSELF I WROTE EVERY LINE OF CODE ;-p
open source ftw
can get cheap/GOOD/easily-maintained-[and-often-for-free] software
benefits tons, not just me


i should strive for more than what i currently am
d3fault is not enough
well, d3fault will be my baby
i'll code a lot of it i imagine
for fun, because i love it, because i need/want to understand it down to the very last line
but i can dish out 'ideas' to my minions and also dish out subfunctionality of d3fault that i don't care to implement myself
with ease

i guess ABC will be that platform?
or d3fault itself?
i guess both
ABC initially
because d3fault won't even exist for soooooo long
dht is such a difficult problem
$20 says the solution is 'simple'
