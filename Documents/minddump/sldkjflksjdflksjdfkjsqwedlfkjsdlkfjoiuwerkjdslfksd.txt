#define THE_UNIVERSE "meshy (mushy, tangible. think: rubber) arbitrary 4-dimensional thing" //i've read about people claiming there's like 10+ dimensions, but none of their explanations made any sense (WOO FOLD A PIECE OF PAPER IN HALF AND THE FIFTH DIMENSION IS WHERE THE POINTS TOUCH! -_-). might just be because i'm stupid, but could be them instead (at the very least, they fucking suck at explaining things)
