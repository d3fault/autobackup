I've managed to put my dad's bad side (he has a good side too, but it's hard to see/appreciate - his bad side more than negates it) into minimal form: He passively controls people with the threat of annoyance and/or fear. I'm not ashamed to admit that his yelling/screaming/raeging used to scare the living shit out of me when I was a kid. Now it's just annoying af. Confronting him is pointless, it's "his house" and he can behave however he wants (I do actually completely agree with that right (but I also think kids should get sound proof rooms the moment they're born xD (scratchin' mah own itch :-P))); it just makes him a shitty husband/father/grandfather/etc. He either doesn't know that or doesn't care, I'm not sure which. Well whatever, I'm leaving soon (rollercoaster of emotions lately: wake up in fear sometimes, ecstatic for freedom during others. I need to be out there before I'll know).

Even the way he sighs at even the slightest inconvenience is enough to drive you mad over 26 years of it.
