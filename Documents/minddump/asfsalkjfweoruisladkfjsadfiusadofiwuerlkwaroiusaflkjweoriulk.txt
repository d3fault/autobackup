it is logical to think that my subconscious
whether in the form of every other human i see
or not

wants me to launch

hence all the inspirational music

whether a collective conscience
spying
whatever

don't let the paranoia eat you alive (like it already is)

'they' love icons

they'll eat you up
suck your dick
then spit you out

you're already dead
and you're already an icon
do you want to die unknown?
do you want to live unknown?
