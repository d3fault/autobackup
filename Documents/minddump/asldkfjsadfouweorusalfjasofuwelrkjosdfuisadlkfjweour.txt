<just started playing portishead - dummy>

this album
it brings me back
to those peaks

my most orgasmic thoughts

the stem of all my work

it makes me cry

there's a purity to it that i just can't see sober

i'll trip again later to see it
but i need to work now

i know my work

i know what i'm doing

every time i trip now i always just conclude: do the work

DO THE FUCKING WORK

code
launch
etc


i always think it'll just take a short while

but meh

i'm still not there

it makes me want to cry

when i reminisc about those thoughts

and how i'm just wasting this life :(

probably my saddest thoughts

this album is very emotional to me
it plays a large part in my life
i will listen to it thousands of times
i will even purchase it if i need to, then release it as by-sa

'all for nothing'
such a depressing line
but idk also liberating
nothing to LOSE either
FLALE MOTHERFUCKER

you're getting it
you're getting closer
to merging

your sober and peak

i doubt i ever fully will

but i think i can progress onto newer thoughts once i've launched
once i've coded more


but then again

i might always just think: code d3fault
etc

fuck.

i doubt i'll ever FINISH d3fault

impossibru

so i hope my peaks don't remain the same (typo: th3)
lmfao

life is such a grand experience
words cannot describe
it sounds lame even trying


i think i should launch with portishhead dummy + 5meo

even if i have to buy rights to do so (not necessarily OWNERSHIP rights, just 'usage' rights)

couple Gs tops
worth it

i can't wait for it
for that sobering moment: OH MY FUCKING GOD I _AM_ LAUNCHED
it makes me shake just thinkinga bout it
nervous or cold idfk which
but so fucking pumped
so probably nervous~

i won't plan what to say
i'll just ride the high
whether or not i know as i'm peaking that i'm launched is irrelevant

speak yo mind

i am the product of insantiy
insanity is the product of evolution
evolution is the product of existing
we cannot not exist (else we cannot evaluate this sentence)


^^wow that paragraph is fucking priceless
