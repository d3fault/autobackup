It is interesting that, the electricity that flows into the guts of "int main()" as if it were water taking various canals based on arbitrarily predefined switchable "gates" that act and re-act upon one another and the main source itself (they are all of it)... like a rube goldberg machine, has the same starting point that I myself do: Teh Big Bang. What came before that? Fuck if I know.
