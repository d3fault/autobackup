Lucid dreaming while sleep walking poses a problem. If I was to "belly flop into a canal" while sleep walking, perhaps I would be jumping off a bridge, building, or cliff. Even my "am I 100% sure I am dreaming?" tests won't help here. Luckily I don't have a heavy history of sleep walking (when I was a kid I was woken up numerous times to go to the bathroom (bed wetter SUP), and I remember barely any of the times). A solution is to lock myself up when I am sleeping... but then now there is the problem of testing to make sure that I am awake (in order to be let out). Surely my sleep walking self could pass the same tests, since he, too, is me.

All three modes of existence (dreaming, tripping, "awake") can confuse be confused with one another (and they can even STACK!). The most important thing is that you never confuse being awake with the other two.

Dreams and trips can appear identical to being awake..... but does the opposite hold true? I think not. I can't recall a single incident where I was awake and thought I was dreaming/tripping.

The most likely cause of disaster: tripping and thinking you are [lucid] dreaming. But that solution is easy: lock yourself up while tripping. Trips last a relatively consistent amount of time.



THE PROBLEM (in the first paragraph) EXISTS WHETHER YOU ARE LUCID OR NOT (sleep walking is dangerous)
