Innovation is stifled by the comfort of your day. You grow up in the world around you and you accept implicitly that that is what the world is. If we lived longer and lived through the various changes of our universe, it would be a lot easier to pinpoint when we're stuck on something stupid (capitalism, for example -- but definitely not the first/only/last).


'comfort of our day' sounds fancier and more poetic ;-)
