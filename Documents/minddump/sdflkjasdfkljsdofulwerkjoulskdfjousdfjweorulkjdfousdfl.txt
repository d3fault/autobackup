Not fearing death is the most difficult prejudice to overcome. Very few have done it. When you do it, your life catapults forward relative to your peers. Perhaps Caesar was the last to do it... and maybe he didn't even know he was doing it. It was a power grab for him (sure he died... but he also ruled the world).
