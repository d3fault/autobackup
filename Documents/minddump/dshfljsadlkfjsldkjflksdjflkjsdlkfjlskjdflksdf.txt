I'm like a man in a dark room sitting in a chair with an electric helmet on his head. There are periodic light shows in the region of his brain that the the electric helmet encloses. All he has to do is flip the switch and it is on for everyone always forever (but accidents happen *gasp*)...

I don't know what I'm talking about, because I can't know what I'm talking about, because I haven't learned what I am talking about.

THE QUESTION (rofl)
WHY DO I FEEL SUCH HATRED TOWARD GOOGLE
because they feel such hatred toward me

spying, censoring, etc, all qualify. i don't want to be angry. i want to swim in love.
now i'm confused, do i say fuck you here?
