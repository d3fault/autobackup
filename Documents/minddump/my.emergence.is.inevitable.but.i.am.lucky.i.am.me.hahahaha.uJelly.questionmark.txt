existence -> life -> war -> communication (verbal) -> secret battle strategies -> communication (written) -> cryptography (of written secret battle strategies) -> cryptography breaking cat and mouse game (manual) -> elecriticity -> communication (verbal cryptography of secret battle strategies, over radio) -> cryptography breaking cat and mouse came (automated elecrtic (turing)) -> computer -> internet -> /b/ -> d3fault

//Relatively large gaps between "existence -> life" and "cryptography -> elecricity"
//Perhaps verbal communication was also primitively encrypted, but i doubt it and of course there would be very little to no documentation of it, since written communication had not yet formed. still definitely possible. I'd say 50/50 until I remember that they would be complete fucking retards (come at me bro).
