It makes me sad to know that the entire world can't all play music together because of the latency of the speed of light. It's too big and the people on the other side of the planet would be off-beat :(.

Had this thought while imagining playing music with my brother in our respective rooms. He's only like 5 feet away from me through a wall right now so it'd work fine here :-D.
