Life is just a collection of thoughts. Your thoughts can control your body and your body can report signals back to your thoughts, but your thoughts are where you live. Our bodies SEEM to be "us" (and we do in fact depend on them) because they are the only thing our thoughts have ever piloted. We could take our brains out and put them in vehicular (because bipedal would make this example meh) robots and drive those around with our thoughts as well. It's hard for us to see/understand that our bodies are merely controlled by us, they are not us.
