I'm a greedy self centered son of a bitch just like the rest of us. It's just that I dream of ultra fucking DHTs and feasible yet ambitious softwares, robots, and lives. Cyborgs and adrenaline. Music and infinity. Weightlessness for all. Danzig, codan, trippin... (or substitute whatever the fuck you want here)... love for all... bliss... alive... drunk proof operating systems and existences... the fucking works. When you get bored of it, you hit the reset button.

I need help to achieve it. I'm using my fellow earthlings/coders. Oh the things you can do with collaboration. I'm self centered just like the rest of us.
