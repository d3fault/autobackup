holy shit i am definitely brainwashed
or programmed
or environmentally biased

however you want to look at it

that blue face/man/head logo i drew

totally a subconscious ripoff of Athome Project (playing on my last.fm right
now)


wtf weird

i know i've seen the picture before
but i did not think about it at all when drawing that head

fucking weird
