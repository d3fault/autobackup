i can
at any point
purchase an adSlotFiller on my own channel for free

because:
a) i own the channel in which i am buying the slot, therefore get the creator's "cut"
b) i own ABC, so i get that "cut"

i thought there was a (c) but i guess not


i can promote (on myself) anything (my own book is what i was thinking in this instance. release everything on the site + in book via lulu/amazon simultaneously (after 'censoring'))



so even if it cost 5 million
3% of that goes to ABC <-- i get that 3%
97% of it goes to the owner <-- i get that 97%

so that's it. i can pretty much override any slotFiller (well, not override... but purchase) for free

nobody else can unless they make their own ABC clone
i'd get 3% of whatever :-P
