You cannot access the internet from heaven. You cannot "communicate" with us. There has never been a Diffie-Hellman between a known-angel and a known-human before.

OR: God won't allow them to network their computers with humans

i say angels as in humans that arrived or [any[one/thing]] in heaven

I would want to network my computer with humans if I were in heaven. I believe that since I would and I don't see that as a necessarily evil endeavor, others would too and those others who would exist in heaven (if it were real) would want to network their computers to our human ones. God would most likely overrule them and not allow it! Or perhaps angels are too stupid to figure out inter-dimension communication whereas it's one of God's special abilities (incl. complete control of body dur)

I take issue with the fact that God does not allow free will in heaven
