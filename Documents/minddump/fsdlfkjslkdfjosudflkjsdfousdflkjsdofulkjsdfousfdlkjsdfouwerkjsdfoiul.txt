I do love Kaylee and still want to be with her (can cope without however), but I need to be alone for the launch. Can't Caydon either. I would modify myself and perhaps even become "comfortable", pushing myself less and being overall less extreme. I am redefining humanity/reality (utilizing computers/programming), so extreme is a necessity. My life shouldn't even remotely resemble what it is today (this is part of my torture: knowing it can be so much better and yet having to be "patient" (patient turns into procrastination, so DON'T BE PATIENT BITCH ASS MOTHERFUCKER (still some patience is needed even when coding at full speed. it takes time))). After my "transformation" (lol @ cacoon/butterfly analogies springing to mind) then I want to be with Kaylee. Then I want to find friends. Then I can start to live and enjoy life. It will be bliss. If it isn't, I will kill myself. bliss() || die();. Don't "need" (water, oxygen) Kaylee for it, but I think she would increase the level of bliss tremendously. Or maybe I find/meet some other "lover" (will ALWAYS question whether or not she's just an actress/golddigger :-/)... who knows and can't predict the future (not counting on it -- math sucks and 7 billion isn't really THAT much).


Water and oxygen is all I "need", but the formula for bliss has just one addition: A good state of mind. That's what all this coding and work will buy me. Retirement to remove the money dependency and life-sucker-outer, and coding just for fun. Being "good" influences your state of mind... to the point that "being bad" will eat away at your state of mind and rot your subconscious over the years: NO THANKS.
