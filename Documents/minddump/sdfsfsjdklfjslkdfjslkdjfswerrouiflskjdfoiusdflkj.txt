even though it's just a simple negation of logic, it's better/safer if you want to "prove something to be true" that you instead prove it to be false. the reason being that if you forget to initialize the value somewhere, it's FAR more likely to default to true (thus not being proved false gives us the correct defaults). If booleans took up a single bit this would not be true, but they typically take up a byte (8 bits of zeros in a row in unitialized memory isn't very likely). that being said, i hate bash scripts that use 0 as true... just fucking confusing is all. and of course, you should always initialize your variables derp, so if you aren't worried about that then this doc is also pointless
