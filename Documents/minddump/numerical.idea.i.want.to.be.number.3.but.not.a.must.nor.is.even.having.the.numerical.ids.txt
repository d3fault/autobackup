there should be a numerical id associated with each logged in user
starting from 1 and going upward
i want 3

but who to give the other 2 to?
i'm thinking robinson and kaylee
robinson's nazi germany attacked by dinosaurs would make him boatloads of cash using advertising technique, if i gave him slot id 1
but kaylee IS my number one... so i kinda want to give it to her. i can't think of what she'd do with it though lol...

i could give 1 to my brother
2 to my sister
and 3 for me

bro could do music
sis could do her blogging shit (and RECEIVE FEEDBACK FROM A LOT MORE PEOPLE)

i could do my mom and dad
but they have no content :-/

1(bro) = demonstration of the music creating experience. fingers (custom input) + guitars (standard recording input)
2(sis) = demonstration of the text creation experience.
3(me ) = demonstration of [whatever i create]. code would be of note
