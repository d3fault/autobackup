we need freedom of information because we need to live in an open environment because nanotechnology/quantum-computing will remove even the tiniest shred of privacy. i don't care how much software you throw at protecting your DATA. your physical person can now no longer ever be secure. remote cameras the size of atoms.

might as well jump in and swim.
living in paranoia is not worth it as i have shown myself over the past few years

we need freedom of information.

CC-BY-SA for freedom of information
LGPL for free market (let's be honest stallman, GPL isn't viable for SELLING software... but it can be viable for selling support for said software. centOS exists)

your information may be distributed anonymously if you choose ('leave author field blank' equivalent)
but it MUST be CC-BY-SA'd
