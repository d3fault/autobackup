chaotic dependency solving

free time dep money dep selling music fingers dep music fingers dep being able to go outside (without worrying) dep replicas/newsgroups/torrents/etc dep figuring out if/how i want to split/post the files dep maybe extracting the relics permanently (but i still have to keep them around lol) for posting to newsgroups, and i have to take into consideration that there are text files and binaries in the relics, so they should be organized/safely-merged accordingly

eh it's just an example of my shit right now, but it changes often (the first 2 links are almost always the same (and for almost everyone those first 2 links are the same too))

idk just random because how the fuck does me organizing my relics with my binary/text files have anything to do with free time? other than (had:othan (man my lysdexia seems to have increased a thousand fold lately, but i'm loving it)) through that chaotic dependency graph, it doesn't.

i thought of this stuff before the "desire for free time stands in the way of free time" doc, and these thoughts i think may have led into/triggered that
