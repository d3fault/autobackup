Consciousness emerging in a life form might seem confusing, and it is, BUT it uses some similar logic as life itself: in alternate universes/etc where a consciousness did not emerge, we never noticed.

We either live in a realm where death is impossible and there is no free will, or death is possible and we have free will. If we live where death is impossible, we don't fear death and therefore don't appreciate life... and we wish we lived in a realm where we had free will. When we live in the realm where death is possible and we have free will (SUP), we wish we lived in the realm where death isn't possible. "Grass is always greener". We can never be happy without free will, and initially/impulsively/programmatically/logically, we are not happy fearing death. The solution is to gain intelligence through logic and to understand that there are infinite occurances of life, and to not be afraid of death (which goes against the very programming that created you).

First you learned to eat, then you learned to clone/reproduce, and then almost every additional feature from that point forward reinforced your fear of death (or simply helped you evade it).

Meh I was getting much more elaborate when I first thought this up.... fuck it.


If you are homophobic and religious, then you're stupid and I don't care to talk to you. If you're homophobic and believe in evolution, then your understanding of evolution is faulty. Remember that if you follow the chain of evolution back far enough, gender (therefore sexual preference) did not exist. Biologically it takes one male and one female (err actually can't a female do it alone now with science?) to reproduce.... but when it comes to "sex for fun" and/or "love", there's no reason two people of the same gender can't be together.
