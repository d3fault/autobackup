I got really excited last time I smoked with Robinson thinking about how I could put a screen in front of lexi and set up proximity activated sound activation to teach her the meanings of objects and even my name. Got carried away and thought about how she could think my name is "what does this mean" (assuming we could teach her to ASK 'what does this mean'... and assuming she only ever asked me). It was a nice tangential thought and I thought "if that's even possible, why aren't others doing it?", but countered myself with "because nobody has YET durr you're surrounded by retards"..... and I almost even feel like it's my duty to help lexi evolve in such a way because hell dogs/cats/etc aren't THAT dumb.... but such thoughts really only make me want to cry (hate that I have to choose what to spend my time on and that I can't save everything/everyone (god complex much?)). That is all.
