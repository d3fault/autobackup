Since I can't not be (...), and I'm either overly paranoid (unfulfilled) or not paranoid enough (fulfilled), life is a jail. It is stupid to be afraid of getting killed by the prison guards while trying to escape it, so the answer (hypothesis) is to be not paranoid enough while living attempting to live a fulfilling life.
