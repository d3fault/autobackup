Trying to unravel the mysteries of life is like trying to find the starting point for the infinity symbol (sideways 8). Except instead of one criss cross in the middle, there are thousands/millions/billions (infinite?). You can spend your entire life trying to decipher and untangle/unravel it, but you'll get nowhere and will have most likely wasted your life away trying. Don't try, accept confusion. There is one exception to this: if you find bliss in trying, even after accepting/acknowledging that you will not find an answer. My "pointless bliss" is writing software (and hopefully eventually/soon making music)... but yours can be anything.

You're eventually bound to come full circle and, if you can even keep all that information in your brain for a single moment, would still probably wonder the significance of seeing duplicate logic in a different form.
