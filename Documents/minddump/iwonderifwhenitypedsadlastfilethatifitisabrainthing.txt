i don't know if i can explore my brain
actually that is not at all what i meant to say
what i mean to say:
i don't know if i can abstract Serial
in the same way I'm pretty sure i can abstract
Network/Threads

but,
i KNOW i can find out
especially AFTER implementing a shared interface between
Network and Threads. then i will see the abstract concept
that is happening in all it's glory


i think Serial is just a state based system

ez

QStateMachine *MIIIIGHT* help, have no clue
shit is easy as fuck anyways

but can i _USE_ it ~~the same~~ as the Network/Threads?
