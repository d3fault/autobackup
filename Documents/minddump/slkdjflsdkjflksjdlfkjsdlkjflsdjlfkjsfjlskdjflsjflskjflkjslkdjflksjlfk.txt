windows stealing focus could be disasterous if you open a file manager, then go to text editor and type some shit while waiting for the file manager to load, then arrow key left a few times and press delete to fix typos/whatever. if the file manager pops up right before you press delete, and the file manager [is stupid and] has focus on some file/folder by default, you delete it. sure most systems have a recycle bin, but if the delete goes unnoticed by you, eventually the data will be lost (when you format or empty recycle bin or whenever)


smartest man vs. most powerful man
My guess is that the smartest man in the world is not the most powerful man in the world. To obtain power, you have to be sociopathic as fuck (the more sociopathic, the more power). The smartest man knows this, and chooses to not be a sociopath so that he can retain his sanity/clear-conscience. I doubt the most powerful man in the world even knows he is. He probably knows he's considerably wealthier than most, and that probably makes him happy... but I doubt he sees how the true extent of his reach/control (though surely he sees some of it) and what he could do with it. He's likely a task delegator and chases money all day err day. He's probably at the top of some organized crime syndicate (which? who knows)
