I was standing in my room with the hoodie of my sweatshirt pulled over my face and i was breathing into the hoodie somewhat sporatically. I had myself convinced that I was breathing into the hoodie at a "subconsciously-hidden encoded messaging system (morse would do)". I stopped. I analyzed that that's just stupid because I don't think my brain can do that level of processing fast enough. Actually now that I'm writing this down I start to believe I can. Other humans prove that it is possible. Plus I could be doing it using some made up Qt QDataStream type of encoding, which ACII-ish (0-index=a) (in order to be brain comprehensible) for the transmitting of..... dun dun dun...... my thoughts. Paranoid much? The scariest part is I know that it's possible. My subconscious COULD be leaking intentionally like a motherfucker, and it could be completely out of my control.
