Before you start, you have to come to terms with the fact that it's all for nothing.
If you don't come to terms with that before you start, you will be[come] devastated(lol sp wtf? i or e or a?) when it happens. When you [realize you] los[e|t] it. Realizing it has all been for nothing IS losing it. The realization itself is the loss. It hurts, bad. So accept it BEFORE you start your thing. This doc is written for everyone, not just Steven.
