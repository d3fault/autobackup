pressing play and watching your shit compile and using it is a sanity checkpoint (for your brain!)
before you press it, it only works in theory
the compiler/computer turns theory into actual

it's the most orgasmic feeling (at times)
the writing of it too
the whole experience


usually, just knowing it compiled is enough reassurance to be relatively sure that the new functionality works
testing is usually just a confirmation

that's what coding is

you have to KNOW it will work
or else it won't


you must understand, to a moderate level, every piece of functionality you interface with

some software you must know intrinsically/ly-a until you write a mere 4-10 lines using your newly aquired possibly-vast sum of knowledge on the software you are interfacing with

software re-use is vital

i want this through a hard-typed service iterator
once a service is defined, the service it implements (of which the implementation of the service inherits/recognizes/is-aware-of) shows up in the . or -> drop-down menu auto suggestion


that should lead to optimal
