In code, sometimes the way to KISS _IS_ to do a bunch of design work up front (which can also be considered [premature] optimization). Abc2 is lacking in the elegant design area, and it's starting to show. I'm just throwing code at it and keep saying "KISS", but it's getting more complex than if I took the time up front to make a proper design................... BUT we all know it'd take me another 2 freaking years if I tried to come up with a proper design ;-).

Still, Abc2 is simple enough that I can keep the spaghetti code in my head until completion... but I bet maintaining it is going to be a bitch (I can always do a proper rewrite). Abc2 is also showing me, or I guess just enforcing what I've already said: coding is slow and if I want to be ultra productive I should stay the design side of things. Yea I do enjoy coding though :-P... decisions decisions...
