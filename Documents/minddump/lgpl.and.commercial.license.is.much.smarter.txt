because you want to appeal to businesses
that's why lgpl > gpl
lgpl appeals to both open source advocates and businesses alike

eventually sell it off like nokia did to digia
businesses are even more appealed to it because they know the COMMUNITY can/WILL maintain it even if the company backing it dies
my mailing list post said way too much lol (i've known this for a while now)
