I'm close to suicide and success. There's a wall a few feet in front of me and I'm going a million miles an hour straight into it. I don't know what's on the other side except that the laws of physics still apply. The tunnel that I've been walking in ("light at the end of the tunnel") has become a cylinder about 1 foot long. I can hold it up and look into it, and even though I know I can go through it, for now I can't see through the other side because of an invisible metaphorical wall/side. The closer I get the more I doubt myself. This is stupid. What I'm doing is stupid. I have nothing. No product. No magic. Yet I was so certain when I started gaining the momentum, I trust my previous (TRIPPING BALLS) self that it'll work. "Build it, do that thing again, and I/you'll know what to do".

Chaos is a hell of a drug.

I feel squished. I've never felt more urge to express myself than lately, I suppose that's a good thing considering the platform I'll have quite soon. Getting harder and harder to STFU. Like this doc... I should be coding and I am writing...
