Freedom of information is more important than any one man's profit.
A person not starving to death is more important than freedom of information.

Both are true.

The problem is in the middle area. The transition. A person (a species) starts off simply trying to not starve to death, but they never stop climbing "upward" because a primitive/evolving species is generally not intelligent enough [yet] to look at itself.... in the third person... or "in the grand scheme of things". They don't know a transition has occurred (or worse, don't care). The stimulus response (work -> eat (not die)) reinforces the greed, and somewhere along the lines you transition from the second sentence in this doc to the first. Freedom of information takes a back seat to greedy men's profit, because greedy men are rightly (had:stupidly) addicted to eating (substitute eating with power/etc, it's all the same).
