Am I the first person (in this bang instance) to learn programming, take drugs, and dig deeply and without prejudice (to the best of my ability) into his own mind?

I like what I've found. That picture yesterday of me clinging to the tree no longer applies. Yesterday's doc was like OMFG huuuuuge... errr... boost in..... something.... happiness/sanity/ego/confidence/idfk....

I am 1.
I am true;
I am > 0
I am.

(we are)
