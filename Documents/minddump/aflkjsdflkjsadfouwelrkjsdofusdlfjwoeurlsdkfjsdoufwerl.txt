between myself and myself (lol wut), there is no fucking way in hell i will finish even a small percentage of my projects
by opening up, by sharing, LGPL'ing [code] + BY-SA'ing [designs, everything else], it's pretty much guaranteed

i am calling upon the world to help me realize my dream. i cannot do it alone


god damnit i'm going to end up being like linus and just accepting/approving patches all damn day :(

but at least my shit will be apps/plugins/etc instead of boring ass kernel shit :-P




i get to stand on their shoulders

richard stallman and linus torvalds

and many others



their LIFE'S WORK is my STARTING POINT


my LIFE'S WORK will be someone else's STARTING POINT
^can't wait to see what it is
