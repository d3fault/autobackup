everything seems dark at times because i am not on a trail. i chose the path less walked, and it is making all the difference. i took a hard left and skipped on both trails. i am foraging through the wild. it is possible i will never emerge to a grassy plane (sp?) with a lake nearby that i decide to call my home. i could be lost in these woods for the remainder of my days. i guess... i need to climb a tree and look at the view, decide where to go. pick a direction that i KNOW will result in an open field. i need to start living, i've wandered far enough. i am lost.
