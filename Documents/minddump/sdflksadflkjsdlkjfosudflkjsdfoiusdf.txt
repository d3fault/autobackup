The desire to use "pure" (non-reactional) will is itself a reaction to the [PRNG] enviornmental chaos. We look around and see what is chaos, to us, and that chaos is what has shaped/sculpted us, and we want to be like it. We want to be what we perceive to be random/original.

Consciousness, by MY definition of it, says that free will has to exist. However it's a ridiculously difficult exercise to pinpoint a single piece of will that is non-reactional. I was trying to find one when I came up with the first sentence in this doc.
