Don't let the depression from the fact that "life is meaningless" consume you. Don't let it keep you down. It could hinder you for the rest of your days. The word "meaning" only makes sense to us humans. I am a firm believer that, since we made up the word meaning, we can also make up meanings themselves! Do whatever gives you meaning. Do what gives you the feeling of purpose. Devote yourself to it and love it. Be passionate. Everything is arbitrary, so life is a blank canvas for you to invent meaning. BTW I am writing this for the reader, this is not self-psychology. Don't let someone else give you meaning. Don't let your job consume you: it is only a way to survive (easily said in my ivory tower of my parents' spare bedroom). Detach. IO deprivation certainly helps, but as it turns out it's ridiculously hard to perform (especially if you have a job to do to survive, but even if you don't (like me) it's still pretty hard because we are surrounded by input and our minds crave output (so perhaps I wouldn't like being in one of those secluded prison things against my will (the name of which slips me)(isolation chamber by will still sounds bomb))).
