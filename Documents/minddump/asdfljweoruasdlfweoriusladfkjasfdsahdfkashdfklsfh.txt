teh chunk server that processes the atomic write
and then he notifies a notifier who notifies the clients who notify the users



or no
i said that wrong
chunk server writes, then notifies a notifier who notifies THE notifier(pusher/updater, cacher, subscriber) who notifies/pushes(or invalidates?) clients who notify the users
the reason there are 2 notifiers
i dunno
maybe not~
but i feel like it MIGHT reduce bottlenecks

i just forgot the thought that backed up that claim
so now it is baseless
though not necessarily wrong

need2think moar





i'm basically making a skip-the-cache-levels writer
it needs to be to be atomic
