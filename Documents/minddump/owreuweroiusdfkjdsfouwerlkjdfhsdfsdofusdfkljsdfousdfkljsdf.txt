I fantasize about killing Obama, the Google execs, and people in similar positions. I think such fantasies make me a GOOD person. I won't act upon those fantasies because acting them out is in fact evil (a broken justice system (so fucking easy to do evil and get away with it) is better than no justice system? leaning towards yes, but my confidence in that yes is extremely low). Since acting them out is evil, over time my subconscience would eat me alive and make life not enjoyable.
