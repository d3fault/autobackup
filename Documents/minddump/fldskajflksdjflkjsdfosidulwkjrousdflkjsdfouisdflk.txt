Possible new name for show: "Fuck Undertones". And if it needs to be child safe for some reason (when I thought of writing this I couldn't think of a reason WHY it would need to [on the internet], but after writing the previous doc.... ehh... I guess now I'm leaning towards this name?): "I Am Not Particularly Fond Of Undertones". IANPFOU meh shit acronym damn. Would almost work if I took 'particularly' out, IANFOU YOU! Pronounced: Ian Foo!

So let's pull a Hunter S. Thompson and call my main recurring character in my novels(?????? movies????? games???? anything??? (yes, anything)) Ian Fou.








Fiction sucks, Gonzo is the shit. I am naturally vulgar, so do I suppress it... and does that mean I've compromised too much?
