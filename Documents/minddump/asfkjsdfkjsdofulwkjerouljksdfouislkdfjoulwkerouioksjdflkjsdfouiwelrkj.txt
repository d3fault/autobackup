We are PRNGs that have deluded themselves into thinking they are RNGs (because RNGs do not exist). I'm ok with that. SEEMS real (as in, actually random). SEEMS like I am in control. SEEMS like I have free will.


...just as PRNGs _SEEM_ random.



Close the fuck enough. So close it might as well be. Like a limit approaching 1 or whatever...
