i just decided if i was ever to have kids, i'd want 3

i was thinking about my 1 kid situation

whether i even want 1 or not


"i don't know if i would want to sacrifice 18 years of my life for one child"

and then logic hit me

it would still be 18 years (give or take a few for the 9 month buffer) for THREE

three isn't that much harder
in fact, it might even be easier: they play with each other. they learn from each other.

it would be my own little army
of brainsoldiers
smart little fuckers

they'd surely surpass me


now i just need some good genes to mix with. kaylee????? ;-P
