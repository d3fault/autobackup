When I'm tripping balls, I fast forward and rewind all over the place. I enter worlds where I see everything crashing down around me, then I rewind to a primitive state (had:age) where I'm self aware for the first time ever. This happens tons of times and they're usually back to back and all during the same part of the trip (same few minute span). The trip ends and I'm back here and everything's as it was. Sometimes happy to not be in such a terrible alternate, sometimes sad to not be in such an awesome one (though I didn't mention awesome ones in this doc so far), but always glad to not be in the primitive state ones anymore.
