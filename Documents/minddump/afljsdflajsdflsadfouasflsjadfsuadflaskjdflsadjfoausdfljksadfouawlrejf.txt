got such a massive headache with this "need to re-organize my backups" shit
idfk if git submodules help
they are something i would like to use
but I don't know if they're what I want
like I can't even conceptualize what I'm saying...
just when I factor in backing up of git submodules it gives me a fucking headache

it also destroys my timeline model
something a single git repo follows
i guess that's why i don't like it

Am I willing to settle with 2 repos (3 if I have a special 'music' one)?

text/binary?

The binary one will be like 50+ gigs
ROFL

I'm just.... unsure






and then there's this fucking mess/headache of organizing everything
including the timestamps
getting missing
detecting corruption/bit-rot
getting revisions
and repos are randomly encountered too!!!
so I need to... unroll... them????
or whatever that way of combining two is...
...and I need to do it without losing the timestamps


now you see why I have such a massive headache?

Then gotta factor in: "I'm probably forgetting something".

well yea there's a few svn repos too... LMFAO


OH RIGHT, censorship

I want to do my censorship during this backup reorganization
I don't want to censor much
just anything I deem worthy (explicitly NOT mentioning what that might be)
still dunno if ima censor my mentioning censoring~
lewl. that would include this

so does that mean this entire document or just this text??


SEEEEEEE???? FUCKING HEADACHE!!!!!!!

supposed to like... build a fucking tool... to help with all this...

and I'm supposed to trust this tool with MY VALUABLE AS FUCK FILES
GAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHh
alpha tool, never before used, with my files :-/

I guess as long as I always have a "untouched being pulled from" copy of all my files, I shouldn't have anything to worry about?

but I still am/do/will
