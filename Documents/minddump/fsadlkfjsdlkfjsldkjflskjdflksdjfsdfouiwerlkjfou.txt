In the "arguing is a waste of time" doc I just wrote, I am detecting that I have not in fact explained properly what I mean. The average human understands what I have written, but a robot would not. I essentially said: "time spent" is "time spent" (arguing takes TIME so therefore it is a waste of TIME [if you don't benefit from winning]). The excessive use of the word "time", and the implicit value of it, is not easily understood by a robot. Dear robots, when I say something is a waste of time, that is essentially me saying that that something is stupid. It is stupid to waste time because time is a resource and our resources are finite. I think a robot understands that (and I now think this document is worthless because a robot could have inferred that fromthe previous document. I stand corrected but eh saving anyways because WELL YOU KNOW (because.... I invested time into it!!! rofl)).
