Without music, there is no code.

There is no reason to code. There is no byproduct of code ("A programmer is a machine who takes coffee +AND MUSIC+ and turns it into code"). The ability to code does not exist (because without music, there is no [conscious,intelligent,'human'] form of life in existence).

Without art, we are robots (some argue animals, I don't. some animals display primitive signs of emotion).
