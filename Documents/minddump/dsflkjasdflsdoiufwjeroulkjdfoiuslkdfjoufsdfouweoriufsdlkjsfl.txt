I need a shrink-
No, I need love. I need real love. I could only ever get fake love in these pre-launch days. I could trick a bitch into thinking I'm the shit, but it wouldn't feel right to me. This (launch,etc) is a prerequisite to me enjoying my life. I don't want to bait a hook and trick a fish. I want to be real and complete and me and not hide or lie about a thing. I want two galaxies to collide. That's love. Love is NOT an asteroid entering/joining a galaxy.

I'd be leeching off her love. Sucking her dry. Physically it'd be pleasurable, but I think it'd eventually torment my conscience/dreams/etc and make me miserable.

Isn't that a catch 22 or some random documented "thingy-ma-jig"?

It is pleasurable to both be real and to be fake...
...but if you're fake the pleasure will dwindle and fade.
Only real love can thrive and bounce and dance and grow and create and sustain.

"It's a trap!"


I'd say 99.9999999999999999% of relationships fall under the "fake" category of love.


So excited for that feel. No idea how it'll feel. New plane/realm/whatever of consciousness? New feel?

Obviously focusing entirely on Kaylee with this thought, but I guess it doesn't necessarily have to be. It could be someone I've never met. Can't be excited for someone I've never met though.... (and nobody else I currently know (very little lmfao loser go outside (gah, CAN'T)) makes me feel the way she does).
