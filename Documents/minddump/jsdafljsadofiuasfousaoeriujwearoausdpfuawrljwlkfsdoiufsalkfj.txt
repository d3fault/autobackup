life is pain
pleasure is pain
systematically, there is no difference between pleasure and pain. the only variable is intensity.

i stumbled into this train of thought while analyzing medical marijuana's condition of "chronic pain"
we are constantly feeling until we die
we are chronically in pain until we die

pain is entirely subjective, so what might be pain to one person could just as well be pleasure for the next
there is no method of confirming pain
pain is a personal/hidden symptom
doctors have to rely on the humans ability to communicate with them (the doctor) to "detect pain"
how could a doctor/lawyer/accuser/someone determine pain? short of sniffing your spinal column, there is no way. maybe years from now we'll be able to call out fakers. until then, medical marijuana is legal for anyone who wants it :)



i was going to save/close but i thought of a tangent
what if a person's subconscious triggered real pain only so the forelobe doesn't have to lie about them being in pain
the person has smoked weed and likes it. they don't have to be [known to themself?] a liar
only their subconscious need be

sort of how mental illnesses can cause physical pain (or what "APPEARS" (LOLOLOLOLOL) to be physical pain. "feelslike" is more accurate)
