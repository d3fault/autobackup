The best/easiest way to piss off free culture fanatics is to create a proprietary work, release it, then "anonymously" (later claim it wasn't you) publish the source code to said proprietary work. After some time has passed and derivative works have been created, claim copyright infringement on the original (and consequently, derivative) work. The best way to defeat your opponent is to waste all his time.

Oh shit why am I giving the enemy ammo?

Another theory about an enemy wasting their enemy's time: Microsoft taking over Nokia and the spawn of QML.
