YOU ARE INSIDE YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR BRAIN IS THE ABSOLUTE MOST BEAUTIFUL CREATION EVER CREATED----------------
but then it stops (sadface)

dont.let.stop
fight
till death
as war
as stories
metaphor or not
grab hold of your balls
they are real
albeit small


cliiiiinnnnnnng motherfucker
you are tripping balls
but you literally have to willl yourself out of death
it sounds impossible
it may very well be
acknowledge and forget

acknowledge and forget
death is not an option
i am immortal


meh, sobering up now
fuck i'm so scared
of death
it's looking right at me
only 60-80 short years away...
i wan tto cry
but i can't een find the tears
i just stare at this screen

now i'm trying to force myself to cry
it isn't working.

i can feel tear ducts filling in my eyes
and i know it will fill good to release them (though i cannot justify WHY)


60 seconds later of staring at the screen: my face remains dry

i am a robot
i mean sure
wetware etc
but i have emotion
whatever the fuck that is~
comprehending emotion is a task i have yet to even attempt
i almost see it as impossible
there may be a reason for that
as the randomness of it stems from natural selection
as in... the randomness of your emotion is your hand delt in the game of natural selection
it's a ruthless game

the perfect emotion (emotionless?????) does not always survive
but love always does
love is not quantifiable
it is a collection of emotions



dude i totally bitch hit that first 5meo attempt. i'm noob to vaping sorry guys
i probably could have gotten twice as high if i had vaped it right the first time


... i actually kinda want to try it again :-P
see if there's any more



there was so much smoke the second time i said to myself 'if i do not trip balls then i just gave myself cancer as that smoke was from the pen tube i am inhaling this with'
and yet here i am, 74 lines later <3 <3 <3
i felt like shouting that out
facebook etc
who gives a fuck
i clearly do

PERSPECTIVES MOTHERFUCKER!
and fuck facebook
mark zuckerberg is a piece of shit
i hope he dies
he will
i will it (do not misinterpret this as a murder request)
