Bouncing around between confident-ish, completely lacking confidence, and indifferent (only felt indifferent when I got up to take a piss and realized nothing had changed). Without the associated Kickstarter it's kind of.... dumb. Like empty I guess, most people won't even know how to contribute lawl. I also feel like I "jumped the gun" and/or "false start"'d, but then I remember just how very little I released. I had deluded myself that much more was released, and that feeling went away once I regained perspective. Still feel embarrassed, but yea I'm definitely asking for that :-P.

I'm not very good at marketting, but I'm glad that I'm not.
