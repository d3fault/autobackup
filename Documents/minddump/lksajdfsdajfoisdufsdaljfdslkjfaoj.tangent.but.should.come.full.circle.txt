AdCaptcha and BlueBox kinda go hand in hand
err, the Video Library i mean... because on it's update page, i will display an AdCaptcha
in that sense, AdCaptcha is a dependency and should be made first
AdCaptcha is also smaller and easier and has a stronger "business" model

"Get paid to put a captcha on your page"
"Advertisers: Guarantee that your ads are seen!"
etc
