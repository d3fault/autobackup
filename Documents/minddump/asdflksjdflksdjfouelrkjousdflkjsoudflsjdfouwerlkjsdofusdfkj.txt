It's taking a hell of a lot of restraint to just just go public now. My paranoia of jacked/lost would be gone.......

....... but it's just not a fancy red carpet willy wonka falling and doing a fucking somersault... entrance.

And entrances are everything (not really though). If I went public now then the whole video streaming ad revenue idea won't work nearly as well (though it probably still could/would). That vector frame of launch would be lessened severely in terms of greatness. It will be by far my favorite vector frame of my entire life... that's pretty fucking obvious at this point.
