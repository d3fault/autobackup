I think the largest indicator that surviving the "big collapse" is impossible is that we haven't already done it. Time and space are infinite. If we emerge from "nothing", then it is very very likely we have emerged from "nothing" plenty of times before. None of them have managed to escape the big collapse.



Or maybe they have and have yet to contact us (because they don't know we're here, OR because going back in the "vulnerable zone" is too dangerous? (perhaps their radio transmissions from the "safe zone" are still travelling to us (perhaps the light indicating our existence is still travelling to THEM))).
Or maybe they have and don't want to contact us (because we aren't yet intelligent enough yet)?
