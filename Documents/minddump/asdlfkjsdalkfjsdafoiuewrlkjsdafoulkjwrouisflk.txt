I have been experiencing lately (on this new spice stuff in particular) a new form of paranoia (at least to me). I've convinced myself on numerous occassions that I am communicating with a) my mom/dad standing just outside my closed door and/or b) the illuminati/etc through my cell phone listening device. The method in which I am "outputting" is by chewing my gum. I sit in my room with my computers off and lean against my bed and the only thing I can hear is my gum chewing. It begins to resemble speaking, though I am pretty sure (now in my sober state) that it is all in my head. I even at one point began thinking that my chewing gum to begin with was a conspiracy (to get me to output against my will). I had forgotten why I was chewing gum to begin with, and later caught myself and the conflicting logic: I chew gum because that spice shit makes me feel like I'm going to throw up within seconds of smoking it. If I don't put a stick of gum (which I tend to have already unwrapped!!) in my mouth within seconds of smoking it, I get a very sick feeling (I still get that sick feeling, but the taste of gum slowly dispersing throughout my mouth (in combination with the high that is taking hold) makes me forget about within a minute or so). The solution to this problem is simple: launch/etc so you know you aren't bein 'jacked' (or stop chewing gum (or stop smoking that shitty spice)).
