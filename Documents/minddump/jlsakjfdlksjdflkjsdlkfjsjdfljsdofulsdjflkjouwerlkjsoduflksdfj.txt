We can literally and physically connect our brains. We can literally become one. I don't think it should be forced because that may in fact be inhumane (perhaps disconnect/reconnect at will (but does individual will still exist when they're all merged into one?)). Regardless, I'm willing to bet that there would be no desire to separate. If done correctly, there probably wouldn't be any desire to.

This is kinda sorta what I was referring to when mentioning the guy sitting in a dark room and electric chair with little bits of elecricity in his head lighting up (we are each those little tiny bits of electricity). If/when we connect with one another (how would that feel??? probably fucking amazing.) to form one, that is what I was referring to as "turning this thing on for all always"... and additionally flipping the switch to light up every molecule in that metaphor man in electric chair's brain.

Existence can be so great but I think we're off track. Money is a disease/addiction. Bootstrapping off a disease, it's difficult to make the argument that you need to sever your source. You are easily discredited.

A few days ago I was thinking: "whether or not I want to save the world depends on my mood", but then caught myself and thought "Actually that's not true at all. I want to save the world at all times, but whether or not I believe that corruption can be defeated (whether or not it's futile to even try) depends on my mood". Hell, sometimes my mood is dictated by the disbelief that corruption can be defeated!

The age of revolution is long gone. The governments have guns several orders of magnitude larger than what the people are legally allowed to carry.

I'm glad that the age of communication has taken hold, however. It should mean no more real wars (now we just have political wars -_-).
