I contest that bikes are essentially stairs/escelators, and can be used as such!
What makes me think stairs will be easier to climb? Especially since there is also nothing now pushing up on your foot? Is that an advantage or a disadvantage? (lol typo: "of a disag"). Man I really need to launch so I can make that auto-typo'er xD.
