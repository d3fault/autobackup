When I sit at tables that aren't fastened to the legs that hold them up (my comp desk is loosely fastened, my parent's glass table in kitchen is simply resting on rubber pads), I want to put my arms underneath them and lift them and throw them to the side, dumping whatever contents may be resting on them at the time (my comp shit -- or just my dinner). I of course resist (MY DAHTAHZ!), but it's been a recurring thought the past few months...
