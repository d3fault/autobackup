I'm against the domestication of animals, with some exceptions (cats with 24/7 access to the outside world through a 'doggy' door, or pets that go practically everywhere with their owner, to name just 2 exceptions). We give them an artificial and shallow life. We remove their fear and search for food, in exchange for their freedom. A cage, a bowl, and even a house... is their lifelong jail. What is life but the traversal of chaos (for better or for worse)? In a cage/bowl/house, there is no (or very little) chaos. These imprisoned domesticated animals surely all have/get something like dementia.
