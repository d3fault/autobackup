I keep wanting to (and maybe am even dreaming about, I forget) throw a spin-as-fast-as-possible off the 1 meter after first going horizontal. So: jump -> 1/2 of a dive (belly flop) -> throw a spin (left or right, but I prefer to spin to my left) -> land either on belly or back or sides. It would really only hurt as much as a belly/back flop (sides rarely hurt), maybe a bit more because of the spinning. Idk would just look weird and really sounds incredibly fun. Almost did it last time I was on a diving board, but when push came to shove it confused my brain (since never done before).

I'm also extremely tempted to try to throw a side flip thing on the ground. Hard to explain, more of a front flip but with a little bit of diagnal'ness to the left.

Idk I'm just obsessed with parkour and WANT TO FUCKING GO OUTSIDE. Flips and spins and danzig and music..... tortured artist I am such a fucking retard because it's my own fault.

Life: while(true) { birth, learn, sit and think about what you want to do, do, die }
My "do" = do a series of side flips semi-danzig to music that I'm also making. So fucking simple and yet here I sit in the dark in this room listening to proprietary music....
