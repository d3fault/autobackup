IO Deprivation saves a form of sanity. I say a "form" because I have already thought out what I'm about to write.

Not leaving my computer any longer... not leaving this house [when my parents aren't home]... also saves a form of sanity.

One sanity is entirely based on the assumption of the existence of brainwash. I can attest to it's existence with near confidence. Television, Movies, and even Books, all present a form of brainwash. Whether in the form of "training" or downright dirty tactics to control your vote (hello Fox News and/or Rupert Murdock), the purpose of output is precisely that of manipulation: always. The monetary gains provided from selling works is to be considered separately. Essentially what I'm saying is that works created for the sole purpose of monetary gain... have no merit. They are shit. They might manipulate you but they do so in such a random and misguided fashion that they are completely worthless. I've seen an author describe a tree or a doorknob in 3 pages. Your overly verbose descriptions are not amusing. Kill yourself.

IO Deprivation keeps my brain from being changed. It keeps me true to myself and to my goal/mission/thingy-ma-jig. Staying inside, on the other hand, keeps me from being "jacked" and/or "deleted" etc etc etc. They are two different forms of security that ultimately impact my sanity.
