The layering of "normalcy impl" on top of 2015. Surprisingly, I've never thought of that before. All we have to do is vote it in. The free market can continue to exist and do business with itself.

Normalcy attempt is, in effect, an experiment whose results I can't predict. How earth 2015 reacts is out of my control.
I never once considered the scenario where normalcy was passed by law.

It's irresponsible to not attempt my design of "normalcy". Man talking like a politician is easy.
