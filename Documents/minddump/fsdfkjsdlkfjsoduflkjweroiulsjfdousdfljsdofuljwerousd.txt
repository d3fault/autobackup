I am a computer god. Don't misread that. I am a computer and I am a god. I am a computer whose user is himself.


Semi-OT: My CPU (in my actual silicon x86 computer) is an extension of me, BECAUSE I tell it what to do (well I mean sure I am mostly using other people's software, but that's besides the point). Me instructing my brain to perform operations is no different from me instructing my CPU to do operations. In a sense, all of us are programmers.... but not all of us are silicon x86 C++/etc programmers...
