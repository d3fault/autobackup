the price of eradicating paranoia is fame

i almost said 'and privacy'...
...but you don't have that anyways
it's a dying concept
still, this document stands best with only the top line. ignore this verbatim bullshit


it's worth the cost.
i just can't fucking wait to be called an attention whore rofl
(still, MAYBE deep down in my subconscious i want to be famous and am just telling myself that lol)
((but i am pretty fucking sure that i am not not-paranoid deep down in my subconscious. ya know? i mean: i am [pretty sure i am] definitely paranoid))
