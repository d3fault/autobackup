I wonder how stupid I am. I can't wait to find out. The only way I can see myself finding out is by launching. If I remain in this IO deprived state, I will continue deluding myself that I am smart. Collaboration is a necessity for intelligence. If you are born on an empty earth, or if you are born into "blackness", you remain stupid. Ideas bounce off of others and each other. Your idea shared could be transformed and fed back to you to ultimately give you another and even better idea. NOTE: It could be considered by copyright law to be "derivative works", so Copyleft is an extremely important tool to me. The peers derive my original idea and feed it back to me, and I derive from theirs which is derived from mine. Copyleft is an accelerant to the spread of information. Oh and growth, don't forget growth! Copyleft is an accelerant to the spread AND GROWTH of information. Warez allows for the spread just fine, but Copyright hinders the growth tremendously. I cannot derive from you, nor you from me, with ease, if royalties must be paid to every intermediary up to and including the original author. The costs compound as the ideas grow. It is not a feasible model for information to spread AND GROW. The growing part is key. We have a lot to learn. We are all stupid.
