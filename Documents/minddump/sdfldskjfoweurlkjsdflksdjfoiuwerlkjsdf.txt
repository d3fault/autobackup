bool afraid = true;
delete &afraid;



yes it is a stack variable
yes deleting it will cause errors
fuck shit up
who knows (i don't)
i am not allowed to be afraid, i have decided
enforcing that will be difficult
but i mustn't.



i was staring at myself in the mirror when i came up with it
staring at my pupil
"there is a conscious inside there crying/screaming/begging to get out"
my face remained emotionless
my physical manifestation is scared shitless (my embodiment of lucidity hurrr red lights fuckin jacked methinks (could be wrong))
BUT MY CONSCIOUS NEEDS TO OVERRIDE IT
fuccccckkkkkk
fear is why i procrastinate
tick tock
do you grasp the concept of time?
you're going to die. you are wasting days/hours/etc by procrastinating and being afraid
death will come no matter what
if you're spring as it comes, you'll likely be much further than if you walk (OR STAND STILL (such is procrastinating))
