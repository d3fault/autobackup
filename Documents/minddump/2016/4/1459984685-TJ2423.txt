GOING homeless was an order of magnitude harder than BEING homeless. There was so much fear I had to face before up and doing it. There was a good amount of preparation too, but that wasn't difficult, just busy work. Now that I'm out here it's pretty chill. Food runs are a bit of work (10 miles each way on a bike, carrying food in backpacking backpack (fuck the wagon, 2slow4real)), but it's more than made up for by the fact that I can be myself out here.


Ehh I don't like the word "homeless". For me it conjures up images of people living behind dumpsters behind grocery stores who play with people's emotions while begging (hurr my car broke down, how original) for drug money. I like the phrase "going and living in a tent in the desert", but it didn't fit as cleanly into the first sentence of this doc.
