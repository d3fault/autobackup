I am extremely happy (maybe it shows in my writing), but since I can't express myself (aside from my writing) I keep it bottled up, which makes me depressed and angry (maybe it shows in my writing), which I too keep bottled up. I know enough about psychology and physics to know I'm going to explode one day, but I think I'm strong enough to keep it contained for years to come. I want to explode with happiness, damnit. The other two most certainly end with suicide.
