I tend to forget my dreams almost as soon as I sit up (and I do sometimes remember them when laying back down the next night (contextual memory is already documented by psychology)). Maybe it's because the blood rushes out of my brain when I sit up. They tell me that water/liquids (blood) conducts electricity very well. Maybe the neural pathways don't conduct electricity to the dream memory banks because they are less wet? Eh it's a wild theory / longshot but fuck it. Also doesn't explain the cont- wait yes it does (but doesn't explain OTHER cases of contextual memory).
