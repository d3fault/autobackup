I've started reading a chem book and a physics book so I can continue Projects/ForFun/Universe0 , but I'm starting to realize it's (like I sort of already knew) just math and formulas and yada yada. Or as a programmer says: "it's an implementation detail" (and therfore not important [to me/my-code]). Instead of declaring Physics, I should just #include <physics> and then instantiate it. But that means the code is [nearly] already complete, so I have nothing to do but twiddle my thumbs and wait for physics.h to exist (prolly already does in some form or another), or dive into the implementation and try to keep up with people who have devoted their entire lives to the subject. Yehh naww. I'll still keep reading them out of curiosity, but I doubt I'll get to the bleeding edge circa 1975 in either subject.
