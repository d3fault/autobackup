Maybe I should just give in to the fact that I live in a universe where there's a plain and simple competition for power, and it's perfectly legal and allowed to manipulate, even sociopathically, and gobble up most/all the power. "Whoever can should and does and that's the way it should be!"; after all, I don't make the rules, I just play by them <---------------- WRONG. I _DO_ make the rules (it's a government by the people for the people, and I'm a person!). Here's where it gets interesting/confusing: those who have gobbled up the power are the ones who make the rules, so if I wanted to change the rules to be more moral, I'd have to contradict my longer term goal of not being a manipulative sociopathic piece of shit. Manipulative sociopathic pieces of shit are the ones with the power and who make the rules, so I['d?] have to [temporarily!!!] become a manipulative sociopathic piece of shit just so I'd have the ability to remove the requirement/incentive for most all humans to be manipulative sociopathic pieces of shit. I know I've said this same stuff in different words, but still.
