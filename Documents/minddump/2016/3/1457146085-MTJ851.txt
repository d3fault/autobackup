I became a health  nut overnight by coming out to the desert. Not because I'm fat or because I'm just into it and stuff (although I should be 'into it'!), simply because I have to carry my food in and I want the most bang for my buck. Unlike fatties, my definition of healthy is "as much nutrition as possible"! Chips and candy are delicious don't get me wrong, but they provide little nutrition. Food runs are a pain in the ass (10 miles.... each way xD)... so by eating healthy, I do fewer food runs.
