I think I got into a growling match with a coyote outside my tent the night before last. It may have been a dream, or mixed reality/dream (my growling real, the coyote a dream). Still it seemed kinda real, idfk. My growl is like a soft "grrr" but with the G missing. If you heard it, you'd think "that sounds like one tired motherfucker". I growl at the skunks/ground-squirrels trying to get into my food, of course. Banging on the side of the tent, and especially scratching (that high pitched sound) seems to work better though. Still I think this time it growled back, kek. I think maybe my body was in fight-or-flight auto pilot mode as I continued to growl at it growling at me. A coyote growling at my growling is one thing, but only a stupid (read:extinct) animal would actually attack a growling sound if they couldn't see the source of that growling. So I won, because animals (including humans) are by default afraid of that which they cannot see :-P......... not because my growl was more intimidating xD.
