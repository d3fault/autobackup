To paraphrase zombieland's opinion of Bill Murray:
Music has a direct line to our emotioin bone.

It makes me dislike the way it's used in many cases. On the other hand, I fucking love it. Advertising and movies use it cruddily... but a pianist uses it right. The first two just use it to make you [emotionally] interested, the second uses it to boost your spirits and mood and well being.

Just like vision is the best way for us to memorize shit, music is the best way to sway our emotions. Paintings etc can sway it too, but not as much/easily.
