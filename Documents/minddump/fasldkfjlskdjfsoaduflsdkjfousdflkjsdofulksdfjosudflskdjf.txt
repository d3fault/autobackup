"this is something" is a known fact (but is essentially a repeat of "i think, therefore i am")
"the only thing i know is that i don't know anything" -- funny simultanously true/false thingo

"this is something" -- not that the sentence is something.... but that everything the reader perceives around him (including the sentence i suppose)... is something. Whether a trip/dream/"reality"/yet-to-be-defined(arbitrary is arbitrary).. this is definitely something. Idk why it's significant, but eh philosophy extremists do value certain facts.

"the only thing i know ..." -- elaborating for fun: the sentence being true (we know _NOTHING_.. a position held by philosophy extremists) makes the sentence false. Although shit now that I think about it... I guess I don't KNOW that I don't know anything... I'm just pretty damn sure I don't ;-).

Ok rolling with that:
"I'm almost certain that I don't know anything" -- has the same intended effect but is more accurately stated.
