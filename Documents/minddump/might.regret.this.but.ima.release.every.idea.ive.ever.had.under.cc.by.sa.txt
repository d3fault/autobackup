now that i've dealt with the majority of my content
and what to do with it

the only thing i'm hung up on now is my slew of ideas
will they be jacked after i release them?

some yes
absolutely

but remember your paranoia is worse
and also jacking + patenting is worse too

releasing is pantent prevention

and also allows you to team up with the entire world of open source developers
only with 'their' help do you even stand a remote chance of coding a fraction of your ideas

you will make less

but you will make enough

just from abc ads + channel ad revenue


i just fear i will have to compete with myself too much
my own ideas will be jacked and then i'd have to compete against them
rofl

it sucks... but open source prevails in the end anyways

entire proprietary sites/businesses will be made
and ideas patented

but my prior works (the idea itself) will allow us to duplicate their work (whether in an open source manner or not is irrelevant.. but i'm choosing open source so the projects live on indefinitely)


i seriously have many billions of dollars of ideas

but not nearly enough time to implement even half of them

what if i have another category?
'proprietary'
meh, against everything i want to do

and i always will be paranoid of it leaking
OPEN MIND
OPEN ACTIONS
PEACE OF MIND
BLISS
ECSTACY

or
closed mind
closed source
paranoia
dead

i can still outsource + open source a lot with my 'proprietary idea bucket'
it's just to keep most of them to myself until i can capitalize on them

which means they can be stolen + patented in the meantime
WORSE: even if they happen to stumble on the idea legitimately


idk


tbh

i really don't

i will readily admit that there may come a day sooner than expected where i regret opening/releasing ALL of my ideas

but i will admit that there's also a chance that i will regret (in a worse way!) NOT opening.. because i've either been hacked/jacked or someone else also came to the same idea and patented it before i could release a prior works "idea:" blob

release: chance of jack, patent prevention, higher chance of finishing with open source communities helping
keep: chance of jack, chance of patent, higher payoffs because i solely take advantage of ideas, way lower chance of finishing everything... but still possible i suppose if i manage my own time and resources appropriately (outsource liberally)


also: keeping to myself means there is 'data' that can be 'extracted'
that's probably the #1 reason to release right there
i don't trust my mind
i don't trust extractors
i don't trust anyone or anything
so i shouldn't.
