If it's worth writing, I will say it. If it's worth remembering, I will write it. Obviously eventually speech will be [auto(?)-]transcribed and become written, but the two should still be separated (tags) in that sense. That's not to say things I say won't be worth remembering (should I not have a keyboard handy or type too slowly to type it).
