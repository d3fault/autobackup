Re: "Fortune is often found in reason's train"

What if logic (had:"reason (logic)") tells you to jump off of reason's train [in order to find fortune (and not the ooo aaa shiny metal kind, obviously)]? Infinite multiverse theory makes logical sense, and it tells me that most of us stay on the train our entire lives because it's comfortable and because we're... just... there... by default. IT MAKES SENSE THAT YOU START THERE BECAUSE REASON IS THE FOUNDATION OF THOUGHT. Back on track: IMT says to push the limits (to jump off the train. to take risks. Existential death does not exist -- only death of instantiated embodiment exists).

Clarifying last sentence with less fancy poetic wording: All matter that exists will exist forever (including the governing laws of physics). That matter and laws of physics are the recipe for life itself, so more of us will always be able to be created (I am glad that stopping such creations is out of my control (although sometimes I feel depressed and in "life jail")). "Instantiated embodiment" = one human being in one universe (keep in mind there are infinite such duplications of it before and after).
