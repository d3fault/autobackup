The best way to 'speed up' any computer (running any OS) is to repartition it and quick-format it. Don't bother tweaking anything or writing any zeros or even backing things up. Your backup process should be irrespective of your operating system... so aside from doing a final increment (should be automated, but admittedly mine isn't atm (lazy)), backing up should not be a part of the process.
