100% is attainable
it may be within grasp for me
no that isn't what i meant to wrote... though it might be (that's for another talk)...
it is... wanted to be attained
many want to attain it
also failed by many (corruption, denial, etc)

fuck, back to the point (texting k0rny)

i would seek to attain it with kaylee
everybody has it with someone
maybe not 100%
but enough.
enough to be incriminating
that puts trust and vulnerability on their shoulders
you feel the urge to spill everything
everyone feels it
everyone resists it
there is allegedly a perfect balance point
but playing the game at all makes you naseous

spill everything and end the game
i mean
to everyone
spilling to your spouse not only doesn't end the game, it also furthers it
and so you would be doing if you established any actual relationships right now

(just wrote 'katelyn' and up to 'first truth' right here but did intend on coming back (what for, i shall have to guess))

ahh, but the question
should i avoid trying to attain 100% since it is engraved into my genes to want to do so? to divulge?
so it may be healthier on the conscience, does not imply it will be healthier for the body

i guess technically i seek both kinds of stimulation
but am i willing to sacrifice one for the other?

can i have BOTH?
yes
but the question becomes:
can i have BOTH and 100% truth mode?

is my urge for '100% attain whatever shits' because i am a human being or because i genuinely want it

you've seen what fame does to people
it eats them alive



((overall paranoia) >,=,< (truth-shame))

i have to figure out which is less than which

equals probably doesn't mean shit.

although.. plausible deniability is a tactic.
but it usually only helps them feel more comfortable than they should be

to me, there is only complete silence
or 100% output truth

anything in between is stupid and unwise
