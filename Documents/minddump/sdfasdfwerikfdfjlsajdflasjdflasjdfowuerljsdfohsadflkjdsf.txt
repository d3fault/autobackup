I remember, now: Sensory deprivation gives you an appreciation of pleasure/pain (feel), just like death gives you an appreciation of life.

The sentence isn't exactly how I remember it, but the two main subjects are spot on. I definitely didn't have the pleasure/pain/feel split in my original thought/sentence.
