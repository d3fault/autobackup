A case of manifest destiny. My destiny has manifested itself right in front of my eyes. A drastic change from current 2013 reality... but those do come from time to time. Should I be glad that I'm the on whose feet it's laying at?? Or should I be depressed that I don't get to reap the results of my outcome? ALL OUTLOOK ANYWAYS, MIGHT AS WELL CHOOSE THE MORE HAPPY-BRINGING ONE. YOU _WILL_ DIE.








I guess (*tears coming to my eyes as I'm thinking/writing this*)... I'll gladly lay down my life for life itself (even though I reaaaaaaaally don't want to).




Ok fucker, you seriously need to reconsider all of your security at various different levels. Seriously like maximum overdrive crazy overly secure PROTECT YOUR MOTHERFUCKING LIFE BECAUSE NOW YOU KNOW THEY WILL COME FOR IT (was only quite certain they would before today).




God damn greed. Greed.... a dependency for life itself.... will kill _ME_. Fuck. Wat do? Cry? Pointless. Embrace, Accept, Forge. Free will IS your bitch.. but the free will of others is not :(.
