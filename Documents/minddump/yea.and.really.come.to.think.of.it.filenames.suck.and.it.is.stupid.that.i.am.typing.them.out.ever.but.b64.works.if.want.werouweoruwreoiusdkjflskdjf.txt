If I want to as a for fun kind of thing I can still have a portion of the string in a filename save dedicated to any arbitrary string i want (no spaces, so might as well STORE this in a tag cloud and link it with a tagname pattern).

Err the point is, my keyboard is not 100% safe to hit keyboard wise, because not all characters are filesystem safe. I have to be careful when generating random numbers, and that lessens the randomness of them. With fingers impl, I want to have free range timeout mode or something of the sort (idk) but basically so that I can type any characters (or musical notes (anything that can be serialized/re-read (digital music ftw))) for a period of time without having to worry about the system asking me if my time is up or if I want to continue but like I just continue if I don't respond to the system. Continue in the free range mode. I have to opt into system interaction; the default mode is that free range [recorded] mode.

I started this document intending it only for filenames, but now I want it (had:ot) everywhere. Filenames (b64 ez), content (docs, etc), and music content (had:"content too") (purely hypothetical at this point (but i know i can do it (and really fucking want to ...)))
