I said recently that I am a software with fully integrated hardware. I meant with my hardware other than my subconscious. That shiz is still confusing and not integrated. He/it sends me binary images/videos/sound all the fucking time and I'm like "whoah, wtf?". Still, it is amusing too..

Also subconscious might itself be [purely] software, so idfk...
