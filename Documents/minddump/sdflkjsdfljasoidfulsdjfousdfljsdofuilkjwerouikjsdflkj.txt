To outsource is to stop learning/improving. You and you alone have the knowledgeset required to write TODOreq and TODOoptimization etc etc on the fly while coding... on a <everything you have every created> scale. When you outsource, the writer now only has the perspective of that one single outsourced project. They also don't care to give you free ideas (and won't). I often find myself writing "low level" code and I think of a "high level" feature/optimization during it (or vice versa). If you outsource either portion, you lose that ability.




.....and yet, coding is so tedious and time consuming that it's difficult to move forward on a macro scale.
