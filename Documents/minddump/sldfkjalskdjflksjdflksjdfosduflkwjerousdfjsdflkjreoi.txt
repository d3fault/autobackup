I remember a moment the other night (where my style of writing fluctuated) where I thought I was on my computer and was happy with the work I was doing, only to wake up and realize I was just laying there in bed. This has happened many times before, and this time I didn't get angry about it. Maybe I valued the work less, or maybe I just have finally accepted that everything I do (and everything I am) is going to eventually be deleted. I mean I feel like I've accepted it a while ago, but it's just settled in more betterer is all.
