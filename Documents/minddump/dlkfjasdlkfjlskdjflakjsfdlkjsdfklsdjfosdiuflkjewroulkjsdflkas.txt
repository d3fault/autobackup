Maybe I am intended to (rather: should) challenge and defy the patent system ("any law which makes an idea illegal, is itself illegal")... but I firmly believe that NO AMOUNT OF LOGIC could sway 'them'. They are corrupt, because the patent system gives them power. I could devote my mind to proving that the system is flawed. I could spread knowledge: give lectures, write papers, address congress, show charts, write software simulations (that generate charts), etc etc so on and so forth... but I don't think it would have any effect. Corporations (patent lovers) own politicians through lobbying (and psbly/probably ambiguious threats to their environment), not to mention that politicians get patent application/lawsuit fees... so it's a pointless fight. Or is it? A thing might seem pointless..... but this country is supposedly built by the people for the people..... surely it's possible to change such a broken piece of the system if the country is truly by the people for the people.

All in all, if I made progress in this area.. I'd just get shot in the face. Worth it? Yes and no. Yes because INFORMATION/LIFE CONTROLLING IS INHERENTLY EVIL.... but no because life > *.






If I forget all this business mumbo jumbo and retract the permission I've given myself to be a serial entrepreneuer etc, then none of this patent bullshit factors in anymore: I can do whatever I want under the purely philosophical safe harbour. The thing is (and the honey trap of greed that 'they' never escape), money gives you power, and power lets you change the world. I have no (or: little (Mig plx)) desire for money, I have no desire for power... but I _DO_ want to change the world substantially. This system is fucking broken and needs a rewrite.
