i really don't care about whether i'm a shemale or not
i don't even think it's worth thinking about
i don't even care to think about whether or not i'll flip a coin at launch
i am now leaning towards NOT doing it, just because.... i don't give a shit
i need to focus more on important matters: LAUNCHING _ASEP_. _A_S_E_P_ (beached whale)
