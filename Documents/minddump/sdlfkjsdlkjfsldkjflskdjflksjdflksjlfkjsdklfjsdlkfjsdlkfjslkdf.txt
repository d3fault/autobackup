Trademarks, Patented Inventions, and Copyrighted Works are all merely "configurations of information". It should not be legal to be able to monopolize any configuration of information. The phrase "Jurassic Park" is trademarked/trademarkeable, but shouldn't be. The trademark holders did not make up either of the words. They are both relatively common words, and the combination of the two (for profit ofc) is very logical/obvious for any intelligent species along it's growth timeline from stardust to being. Alternate species (had:universes) of intelligent life no doubt have "bad-ass ferocious ancestors" (dinosaurs) that most probably have their timespan (had:period) of existence labeled under some "also pretty cool sounding so as to match the animals in existence" period (jurassic). The concept of a park is also obviously portable to another species/lifeform (and it's simple sound is a desireable trait). Taking the word for the "period in which our baddass ferocious ancestors" (jurassic) and combining it with the word for "a public area of recreation/entertainment" (park) is so extremely obvious that the phrase "jurassic park" should not be trademarkeable. It's easy to see how "jurassic park" is simply a configuration of existing information, and it follows that many/most-all/all(?) configurations of information should also not be monopolizeable.

But who am I kidding? Until the problem of "those with the [most] money make the rules" is solved, there's little hope for the above problem to be solved.
