Oedipus complex + luck (I have said this before, but not in this wording)
If I have an oedipus complex, in my case it would be beneficial through luck: my dad is a piece of shit (so wanting to kill him isn't necessarily bad (though I won't act on it)), and my mom is a great person. It's hard to explain this, but err uhm basically not all oedipus complexes are good (we don't get to choose, just the luck of the draw).

People tell me kaylee and my mom are similar. I don't see the resemblance, but they are both kind loving people no doubt.
