Take Qt's actual headers (API not copyrightable, header exception anyways~) and implement them using Boost! Release under DPL. Buys? A Qt-esq lib (because seriously, Qt is the shit) that people can contribute to without signing a draconian CLA. Contribute via DPL, receive via DPL. Using boost would just save assloads of work. Use boost/templates wherever possible, use precompiler wherever you can't (or simply don't want to :-P). Source compatibility with Qt would be the target (always growing, BUT by using their design/headers... you skip a ton of the trial/error phases of polishing a design (and indeed, Qt's is nice) and focus purely on implementation (not to mention you can cut all kinds of corners using Boost (Boost is nice, but it's API is ugly and not streamlined imo. It's (had:more like) a bunch of independent utlitiy libraries whereas-I-want (had:than) a _PROGRAMMING FRAMEWORK_)).

Yea Qt is fucking enormous at this point, but idk I think kinda long term (frozing + indefinite, boredom is the enemy)... probably too long term :-P...
