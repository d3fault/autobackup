I've been watching live cams (porn) lately just for fun. I even inquired about signing up to one, but I didn't get a response after asking if I get to keep the copyright :-P. Back to the point: These guppies are hilarioius. Guppy'ing is a working business model though, AND I WILL USE IT!!! By guppies I mean their yes and overall body language. They all look so trapped in themselves, it's hilarious. Barely able to think. They wiggle their bodies a bit here and there, maybe lip sync to some shitty music.... and this is their business strategy. They are guppies because of their eyes and their business model. They are bottom feeders, feeding off of male (mostly) testosterone (or whatever makes so fucking horny). They stare at the screen/webcam like a rat/monkey stares at the slot that periodically dispenses food when the animal presses a button or someshit. I see myself in them, but a primitive/pre-evolved/STUPID version of myself. I know that without (had:proper (fuck yea internet)) education and growing up such a spoiled little shit and in America etc, I may have ended in their position.
