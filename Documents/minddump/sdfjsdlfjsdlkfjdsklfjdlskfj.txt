Hackers tend to be homosexuals/bisexuals (or as in my case, tranny admirers) because, where a normal [male] non-hacker thinks of "vagina" 99.9999% of the time, a hacker thinks of "penis" JUST because it's in the hacker's nature to give a system unexpected input and to analyze the results. In this case, the result is nothing (if you count a lifetime of shame/embarrassment/public-[humiliation|ridicule] to be nothing, which I do).


Thought of this after writing the above (it stands better on it's own methinks): the result of giving the system EXPECTED input is: a baby.
