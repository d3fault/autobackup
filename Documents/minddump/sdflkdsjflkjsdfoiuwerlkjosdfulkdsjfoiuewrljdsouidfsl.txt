Infinity
What is free will if, no matter what I do, I have definitely done it before and will definitely do it again?

Every action that I don't do also has been done in the past and will be done sometime in the future.

Am I meant to choose the best path (knowing it has been done before) that will bring me bliss, and nothing else? To embrace the illusion of forging a new path because of the childish/silly/REAL enjoyment it brings? Are endorphins really it? Is that all there is to life? Bliss? I think I'm OK with that ;-)
