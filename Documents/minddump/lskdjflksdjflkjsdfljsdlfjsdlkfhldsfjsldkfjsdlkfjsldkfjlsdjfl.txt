The meanings of a words are deduced from association (your mom says the word "banana" every time she shows you or feeds you a banana, for example). Once a handful of words have been learned, new words can be described using the existing words. The bootstrap into language is deductive reasoning. A baby that doesn't know any words, still knows (or at the very least, figures out) deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning (or at the very least, the ability to figure out deductive reasoning (but through what? more deductive reasoning??)) might be (had:is probably) genetic.
