I keep considering the awkwardness of going outside with hat+fingers on. I re-remember that I don't give a shit about other people, I just hate being stuck in my room all day err day. Took me a long time to realize that wanting to go outside is not the same thing as wanting to socialize, but I keep forgetting it. Probably because there's SOME overlap. I also re-remember I can't talk to bitches unless I feel I can speak, and I don't feel I can speak unless it's recorded [AND they see me for who I am (wearing the rig shouts NERD)]. But I'd say the main point of this document is something I just thought of tonight while at the Bechers': I can fill the awkward silence with my music playing. One could argue it's "hiding" behind the music (I won't attempt to analyze that right now). A silent musician is not silent (and therefore still gets the bitches (everything I do, I do to get laid (secondary to my showing off for and trying to get the love of Kaylee ofc))). Put it this way: if you're not saying anything anyways, might as well play some fucking music.

On the bike ride home I fantacized about getting a name/sex change and ditching computers completely and being a musician solely (some stupid job to pay the bills ofc). A life filled with emotional attachment among friends (only girls <--> girls can have it. guys <--> guys can't (it's a different kind of bond (unless they're gay)), and guys <--> girls is almost always sexual (unless one is gay)) is a fulfilling life indeed. I love my testosterone and the fact that I don't have to worry about getting raped while walking down a dark pathway at night time, but I'm jealous of the bitches2bitches friend infrastructure (except when it's just them taking turns bitching about their lives to one another (which is funnily enough a pretty decent percent of bitches2bitches relationships (just like smalltalk makes up 99.999999999% of all communication among everyone everywhere))).
