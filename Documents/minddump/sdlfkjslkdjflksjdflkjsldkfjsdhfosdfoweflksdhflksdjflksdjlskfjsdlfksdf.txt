Technically, I was born in the dreams of some european who sought (had:saught) freedom in the new world. He would have left for the new world as soon as he heard of it's existence. Similarly, I am "using code as soon as I've heard of it's existence" to modify my distant future just as the european did. There are infinite of these dream->realityChange variations, but of course the "leave body of land to go be free on another body of land" is a regular occurer xD.

Honestly though, I want to say I'm born in my own dreams and drug trips. That european guy, or even other technology people, didn't have nearly the same "dream" as me. Mine altered myself, just as theirs did... but mine took a turn around an advanced-technology corner so that there's no possible way (read:is highly unlikely) they could have had dreams even remotely similar.
