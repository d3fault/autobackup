It is both childish and true that my dad stands in the way of [insert various, "my dreams", "it", "me", "everything"].

I cannot legally record myself when he is watching television in the room at the other end of my short all, for the television he watches is copyrighted.


Copyrighted material leads to recording yourself being illegal [except for when at premium real estate (the great outdoors counts just as much as a recording studio, because it costs effort to live outdoors and that is your payment for peace and quiet)].

I cannot live without recording myself (I can, but at a terrible state (see self @ now)), ergo I cannot live legally. I should do society a favor and off myself ;-P.

Everybody, kid and adult, should have their own sound proof (nuke proof as a bonus) space to speak their mind undeterred by both interfering (or is it interfearing?) copyright and dominant (had:dominate) household member.

We are missing out on a mountain of information/knowledge.

I am one of those (at the time of writing).

I wonder if I have a good court case.


As a specific exception to patent law, video and audio should be illegal to control. Video and audio are much too important pieces of information to ambiguiouslyChargeForAndThereforeRestrictFlowOfInformationAndHumanEvolution

ambiguiouslyChargeForAndThereforeRestrictFlowOfInformationAndHumanEvolution:
how ambiguiously, you ask?
Most every device sold today uses a patented codec, therefore anyone who wants to record themselves spreading information must now pay just for that priveledge.

There is always the "use a different device" counter-argument, but supply and demand dictating the free market make attaining those alternate devices much more expensive than to buy the brandedAndPatended ones from storeX, to the point where it isn't even reasonable. In this case, the market is wrong. Cheaper != Better. Humans are losing information, and information is worth more than money (admittedly, everything is worth money eventually (to some people. i don't think there is any amount of money worth more than a human, though)).
