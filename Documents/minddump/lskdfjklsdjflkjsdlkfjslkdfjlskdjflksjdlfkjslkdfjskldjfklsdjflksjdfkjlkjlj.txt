[Literally] Thinking out loud is impossible (read:illegal) unless you're in a copyleft-esq (deriveable... so BSD style licenses etc apply too) environment. BY DEFINITION, you can't think about what you're about to say before you say it. You will inevitably(sp?) and unintentionally infringe copyright.


OT: My brain is unfortunately filled to the brim with copyrighted material, so I'm struggling to "think out loud" and may have infringed plenty of times already without even knowing it. Fuck you assholes. *sues and goes on killing spree* ;-P
