there is a 2 for 2 correlation between me kissing my grandmother and her going to the hospital because her heart begins racing a few hours later. uhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm wat teh fawk?

at least she isn't dead.
i try not to kiss her... but she always goes in for it and i gotta turn my cheek to avoid it
