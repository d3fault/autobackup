fuck einstein

if you travel at the speed of light for 5 years then you put "time on pause" if you are looking back at the object that you depart from (earth)

as soon as you stop moving the object you are looking back at resumes playing as usual (at normal speed), albeit with a constant delay depending how far away you are (TODOreq: parity bits)

if you turn around and travel at the speed of light for 5 years directly towards the object you were looking back at, "time moves double speed" when you look at the object you originally departed from

light is relative, time is not

because of that phenomemenemenemenemenemenoenoenmeneomeoneoneomeneon, you arrive exactly 10 years later and have neither gained nor lost time.

Why the fuck do satellites need to re-adjust their time all the time then? Is my understanding of timespace faulty?

Why does time move faster the closer you are towards mass? Isn't that the contestion (or at least opposite) of the whole time travelling bunch?

I understand exactly what is being said (or so I think): that time moves slower the further away you get, but that doesn't make any fucking sense to me. Perhaps it isn't what's being said? Damn I am dumb [maybe]. I don't feel like turning on my online computer and looking it up.
