War forges them into men who will die for freedom, but then they go home and love their wives too much to tell them that they're being oppressive cunts. The women get confused and think that they are freedom. They invent the concept of "proper" (control/submission/anti-freedom), and their hubbies go along with it because women are just too damn sweet (and sex/blowjobs are just too damn nice) to shoot in the face.
