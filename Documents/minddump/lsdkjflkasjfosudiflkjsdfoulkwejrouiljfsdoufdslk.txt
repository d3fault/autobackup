I have it!

The question:
wat do?

The answer:
Something Anything Because: Tick Tock


If you ponder upon it for too long, you run out of tick tocks and die. Think shorter term. Think arbitrary. Think personal pleasure (if it happens to coincide with the general welfare, that is a plus). Do not seek a holy mission. Do not seek a "calling". QUICKLY JUMP TO A DEFINED-BY-YOU-GOAL. The quicker you jump, the less time you waste.
