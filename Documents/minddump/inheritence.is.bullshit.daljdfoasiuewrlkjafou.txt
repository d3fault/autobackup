inheritence is bullshit
you remove incentive for your offspring to do anything at all
there should not exist inheritence

peace of mind can be achieved through the "normalcy" / "global welfare"
your inheritence becomes public domain divided evenly upon death
not even your wife gets it



BUT WAIT
couldn't they just give their money away right before death?
yes. therefore this would never work
but it still holds true: inheritence is bullshit
you are not helping your children/their children/etc
