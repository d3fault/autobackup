A lol idea is to publish the book and site and to not tell anyone about it and to just sit in silence coding as usual and to wait for it to catch up to me :-P.

The idea sucks because the actions I do on cam during the first few moments(+hours(+days(+weeks(+months(+years is crucial/important and err leik yea. I want to be on fucking video, that's the point. The book and site and old data are stupid.
