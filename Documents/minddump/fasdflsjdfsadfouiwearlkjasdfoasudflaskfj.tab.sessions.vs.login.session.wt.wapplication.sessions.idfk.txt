a user logs into a wt app
there is a menu with 5 options
he middle mouse clicks two of them

...do the new tabs have their own sessionId?
how does the WServer.Post work?

does each tab get the internalPathChanged signal?
that question applies both to the first tab (that i use to open up 2 other tabs) and to the 2 extra tabs when i navigate to items 4 and 5 on the menu


does it count as 2 users being logged in with the same username?

is it 1 login 'session' and 3 separate wt 'sessions' (WApplications?)???????????
that 1 login 'session' being shared across all 3 wt 'sessions'...

IDFK

needs moar prototype/testing


oh and of course i can't forget that each page has server push from a qt-singleton-thread-backend
it might be good to practice the LEAVING of pages (and telling the backend NOT to notify us for those values anymore) too...

maybe each of my tabs (wcontainers in a wstackedwidget) can implement from something that has values that it communicates to the back-end with to get notifications/updates for said values. idk.


you know come to think of it i can test this already on ABC's code.... lol
most of it

...and to think i almost wrote code to test this rofl





...and if the two tabs navigate to the same page... our back-end needs to be OK with that (i guess..)
