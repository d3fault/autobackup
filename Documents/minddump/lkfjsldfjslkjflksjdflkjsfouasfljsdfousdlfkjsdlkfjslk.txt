Don't deny your killer's existence. The way we evolved (survival of the fittest) means we are all killers (well not necessarly.. but for males it's pretty much true). Suppress it, yes... but outright deny it's existence? Stupid. We rage and love the adrenaline, we fight and ditto. Killing is a way for us to express ourselves maximally... and now that we don't need to anymore the desire to go into berzerker mode is rarely satisfied.
