I'm a theorist who likes to do applications (because nothing [tangible] is created in theory (unless you write your shit down, but I digress))... but when I get down to it, applications take a million times longer to implement and I miss the speed of pure theory.


I like my current plan: toggle back and forth between the two at will. I can theorize in five minutes what would take my entire estimated life span (~80 years in 2014 on Earth) to complete.
