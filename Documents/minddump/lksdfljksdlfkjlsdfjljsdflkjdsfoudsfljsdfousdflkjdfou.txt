Durability fail (fail before replication/persistence) of a key claim means the key will be claimed by two usernames. They would then share the key and each of them would get the TOTAL balance that each of them end up putting in to that key (if they coordinate, they can both get exactly twice what they really paid). It 'steals' from me in an indirect way... by taking ad slots that would have otherwise been sold for actual bitcoins. I hate life
