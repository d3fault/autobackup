wwkd
i want to do what she does
or at least what she appears to be

she's either the only good person i know
or she's a really good actor actress*?

i want to be the person she, (or the character she portrays), would want me to be
it's the exact same role i would 'play'/eventually-become if i was to win her over
but i'll just accept defeat and try for that role
not knowing her i can just fill in the blanks
it's kind of creepy and i would be thrilled if she fell for me
