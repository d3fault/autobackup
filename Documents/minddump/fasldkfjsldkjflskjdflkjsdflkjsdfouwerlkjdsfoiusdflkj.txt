I just visualized myself _using_ rpc generator and I was surprised by my own design to remember that all I do is call a message factory, then call .deliver() to send the request to the server and then .doneWithMessage() to recycle the response. OMFG I CANNOT WAIT TO USE IT. I've been coding it for way too long and fucking hell this is turning out to be a bitch, but there are a decent amount of them bitches that are being abstracted away meaning I would have had to do them multiple times and hated my life but I am paying the cost up front. It seems like it's slowing me down, but it's going to speed things up so much once I have it up and running. It will be the equivalent of building a mech that takes bigger steps. Sure you can get way ahead of me by walking while I am crouching/standing/etc and working on my mech, but I will ultimately catch up to you and make it further than you in the long run (this isn't ALWAYS true, but in this case i think it is).

An object hidden behind a wall from view from the street to which the wall is parrallel, can always be seen if the street is infinitely long. There is a different width that the item may be protruding from the wall and the point at which a car driving away but looking back can see the item at different points depending on the width. Or something.

The part about infinitely long street is especially cool, because (oh and we're talking about (nvm just realized I'm wrong entirely))
