I am putting my conscious and subconscious under the microscope for all to see and study. If you learn something about me that I haven't yet realized, please tell me. Fuck shame, fuck embarrassing, fuck paranoia, fuck [any construct of my mind which censors/etc (itself or otherwise)]. To make things interesting and to be a part of the "TEST" group (we still need "CONTROL" groups) I will throw a myriad of psychoactive substances at it. Shit's pretty fun even when it's the scariest thing ever. I will bind myself when doing things that make me lose complete control (PCP comes to mind, but I haven't tried it so that's just from readings). I will not risk death or even allow myself to bring it upon myself while tripping complete fucking balls. Tie me up (or I tie myself up) and don't let me go until the trip is complete (or a computer timer can auto-unlock/untie me ;-P). Safety First!! Death is real, though I won't "miss myself" after I'm dead (also, there are worse things than death).
