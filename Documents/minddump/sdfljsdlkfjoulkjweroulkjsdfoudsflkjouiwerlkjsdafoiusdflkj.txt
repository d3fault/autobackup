Caesar was a noob. A reasonably intelligent person in the right place, right time. Protip for societies/empires: don't declare your own citizens/generals an enemy of the state to which they belong (especially when they are at war, commanding "legions", on your behalf when you do it)! They then have the "human right" to return and take it by force (usually they can't, but in the case of Caesar, he could/did). I am reasonably intelligent also and in the right place right time, but intelligence since then has come an order of magnitude further. THE FUCKING INTERNET AND COMPUTERS AND PROGRAMMING _HOLY_ _FUCKING_ _SHIT_ THIS IS SOOOOOOO COOOL <3 ;-P. Also drugs (then again they had them too... but it's obvious that if Caesar did psychedellics, he hid that fact).

The algorithm (that Antoni was trying to recreate in "Rome" Season 2) for it is basically to get your peers (senators etc) to declare war on you while you're away (prerequisite: "legions"). You must do so retaining the support of the people, but they're easy manipulated anyways, the sheep.

He's also evil if he really went around killing people (Romans, critics, etc) on a whim so fuck him for that. I am good and will be somewhat less likely to be assassinated because of that.... but mostly I will sleep better and not worry about "revenge" etc.
