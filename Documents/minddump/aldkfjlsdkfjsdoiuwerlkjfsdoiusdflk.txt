the general processes i felt while turning on my computer
i want to elaborate
it was like i felt like i was living in the "now" for the first time ever :-/
sure i feel it quite often actually while high but this time was different
i comprehended and understood (to the best of my ability) "reality"
all i really did was like turn on my speakers and put on some music on my droid and shut down my online book and closed the lid because i am afraid the webcam watches me type (rofl, but ***definitely possible***) and then turn my computer and monitor on
i could like
understand my synapses triggering my muscles causing me to press a button causing electricity to flow into the 'system' which is basically a computer and even how the music uses pulse width modulation to make the speaker vibrate at certain frequency and it changes that frequency 42100 times per second and it does it so fast that this thing called "music" comes out
i was doing that in realtime and turning on my computer had an equally fun "understanding" (that requires a programmer to get. wow cool that music metaphor/EXPLAINATION (it isn't a metaphor what am i on about) has another use!)
by realtime i mean like i was watching myself slide on data-driven (though purely only in my brain atm :() molecularly-driven reality
shit was so cash
we are all on rail shooters
except the future is presented to us in a random and modifiable pattern. if you can predict what will happen with relative certainty in the immediate future (what is right in front of you), you are able to change it
you can also create arbitrary rails of... will
leik donny darko type shit yo
except i had an undestanding of EVERY PIECE (molecule in sight i guess)
not just random ass water streams coming from my fucking chest lmao
it felt good
as did that self-induced mindhack
ima try it again: minddump
lol there aren't any good ones in that
m1nddump






and now i guess i skip down and write something else minddump
well that was lame i wanted to force myself to get it wrong which actually makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE AT ALL
you just have to like
let it go, let yourself flow
NOT GIVE A FUCK
because if you are watching for it and/or forcing it (they are one in the same), they CANNOT happen
so the key to life IS not giving a fuck
i've said this NUMEROUS times before
you must do it in the most just and "do no harm"-complying (because SOMEONE has to do the enforcement, it REQUIRES action/maintenance -- hence 'complying' and not something that would make more sense 'benefitting-from') way imaginable
luckily there are idiots who want to fight for the thrill of fighting :-)............. or who can just be talked into fighting (and that's the world we currently live in. there are definitely 'illuminati' at this level. fuck war)
