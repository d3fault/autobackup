"that's my idea of romance"

to kaylee:
i can't wait until they have all stds and 
err i thought like the genetic disease that the kid would have was an std
but the thought went 
[obviously not to kaylee]
i can't wait until they have all stds and other genetic disorders fixed so we can just have sex with anyone
i like traps because i've watched way too much blowjob porn
i can't wait until we can all suck each other's dicks and fuck everyone and get fucked by everyone and not have to worry about a damn thing and we can just have sex with each other over and over. i do think we'd eventually become just 1 male cousin and 1 female cousin mindset mentality of having sex with that person infinitely while robotos "do their thing" (fix all our problems with ease)
THAT's my idea of romance...
