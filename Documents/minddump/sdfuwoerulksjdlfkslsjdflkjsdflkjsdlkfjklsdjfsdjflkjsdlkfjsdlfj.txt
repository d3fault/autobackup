As if I needed more proof that shell scripts are fucking stupid:

#!/bin/bash
xrandr --output DVI-0 --primary --auto --output VGA-0 --auto --right-of DVI-0

...errors our and doesn't work (both my monitors went blank. luckily i had the command to fix it memorized)

whereas:

#!/bin/sh
xrandr --output DVI-0 --primary --auto --output VGA-0 --auto --right-of DVI-0

...works as expected



ffffffff wtf?

sh doesn't work sometimes, bash doesn't work sometimes, give me some fucking consistency!!!!!!! (<3 Qt)
