That contradiction is now the focus of my brain. Fuck licensing and patents and all that bullshit (I am still LifeShaping ahead at full steam though). It fascinates me and I think it's a more interesting discovery than whatever the fuck I wrote about just a few days ago as being my most interesting discovery. I want to label it "the d3fault dilemma" (replace "d3fault" with whatever EXISTENCE-RELATIVE word you choose for your conscience in a void). My first hypothesis is that it's better to "live a fulfilling and not paranoid enough life" for > 0 minutes... than to "not live a fulfilling life but to be paranoid enough" for > (> 0) minutes (as in, more minutes than the other).

I'm not sure though and I'm still bombarding the contradiction with as many questions/solutions as possible: perhaps we are only meant/"allowed" to live as fulfilling a life as being just overly paranoid enough allows for us.

Perhaps it's another unsolvable and shouldn't be given TOO MUCH of our time (because it can/does take all of it)? Maybe.... but I'm willing to give it a few more X (couldn't think of a word for X (years? weeks?)).

I want to hit my friend-of-respected-intelligence Nick up on the subject. It has nothing to do with drugs/insanity... and he can definitely grasp the "security is a sliding window" concept. Maybe the solution is easy and I just need some fresh perspective? Bah, I can't until I launch :-/...
