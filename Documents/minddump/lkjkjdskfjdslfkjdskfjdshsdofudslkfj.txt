I once wrote that [G|D]PL _plus_ is essentially copyright assignment. There's one huge difference: With "plus", the author doesn't lose the right to license the content under other licenses. With assignment, they do. Still, "plus"-ing kinda sorta makes the license author (rms and me in GPL and DPL, respectively) a co-author (but they/we don't have to get the other co-author's permission to license out the content like in a traditional joint copyright ownership setup). There is some assurance, though, in "plus"ing: if the license writer himself "pluses" all of his own software projects (and I'm pretty sure rms does... and I obviously do too), you can be sure they won't (CAN'T) do any worse in/with future versions of the license to affect your "plus"d works worse than they'd simultaneously do to their own works.
