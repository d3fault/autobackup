I keep wanting to write shit like "I love you kaylee and I'm sorry for creeping you out. I should have been more patient and waited until I have an 'accomplishment'" yada yada.... but every time I do I change my mind and say to myself: NO FUCKER JUST CODE LAUNCH AND _BE_ SOMEONE SHE'D ACTUALLY WANT TO LOVE. Words have very very very very very little value. Hell I shouldn't say anything to anyone ever (until launch), but that's a subject for another doc.
