I have achieved existential bliss, but my writings are worthless. It is only on the path of self adventure (discovery?) that the experiences needed to achieve existential bliss are found.


Diving into your brain counts. To say it doesn't is similar to an aerospace explorer saying to an oceanographer that the oceanographer's work doesn't count because he isn't looking "outward".


That being said, I still really want to go outside damnit.


I want to live in a hammock in a tree and spend the rest of my days coding and listening-to/making music, one legged drooping out in a cliche lazy sort of fashion (both hands hanging off the sides as well).


Outside is awesome, given proper UV protection. I should be umbrella man.


The cost (weight and management effort) required to own and operate an umbrella far outweighs the benefit (not having to deal with people, who are generally in buildings where an umbrella isn't warranted). I can stand over near some trees at the edge of some parking lot and laugh at people parking, going into the building, and coming back out.


An umbrella, a backpack full of batteries, and a few computers that together make up one computer in a fault tolerant manner. You can guess the rest. I hate myself for still being sitting here, I hate myself for saying I hate myself for saying I hate myself so much.
