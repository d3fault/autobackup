re: calculus
"push it to the limit" was right all along
i think i can say with absolute certainty (99.999% "limit" thing in calculus) that i have been in this exact body and mind before. who gives a fuck. how long does the snake stretch? what do i do and how does it end? use the "free will", whether it is fake or real (pretty sure it's real in some respects even if it's fake), you can do anything you desire with it.
