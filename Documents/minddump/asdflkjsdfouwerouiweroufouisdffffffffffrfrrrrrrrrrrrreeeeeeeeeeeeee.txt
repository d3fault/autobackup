so many options


and the more I progress
(move forward)


the less options remain





do I really want to go public?

Fingers + Broadcast?


I could be sufficiently rich and unknown
unknown
unknown
unknown
unknown



lief
what is this thing
but a chance to express yourself

you'll be unknown when you're dead

you'll be a reference point only

nobody can know you because you will cease to exist (this isn't to say that they won't know OF you)


as much as I am a proponent of anonymity and security, I cannot cower in fear my entire life.

I want to dance. I want to speak. I want to live.


whether I have additional monitors / identities unknown to all is irrelevant and can/will be decided by me whenever


but I really want to launch
because I can.
and eventually cannot.



'they' win if we are silenced
remain in the shadows
'cowards' they'd (do?) call us

but I can be a point of reference

an endorser of anonymity
perhaps even a victim of it.
I am willing to accept/forgive that

whoever has me killed by c'tuhlululululu for fun:
I forgive you

even though you aren't sorry
I understand why you'd do it.
I'd do it.
for teh lulz.

I have to cling to my infinite multiverse theory to stay alive.
or just never go outside (broadcast indoors/underground 24/7)



OR, if you're too scared:
take the anon route

it isn't too late

well, it'd never be too late

but right now you don't have a name

you can choose not to make one


I refuse to remain in the shadows
it's even plausible that anonymity is a guise to promote silence
because the masses don't listen to Anonymous
the masses don't listen to reason
the masses listen to names

falicious, yes
true nontheless

I can be a point of reference
therefore I should


"all those anonymous cowards"
...
except for d3fault


he's an anonymous hero

I am not anonymous at that point
but I can/should/will endorse it
I will even build tools to attain it

I will be a reference point
I will be a rally point

I will live paranoia free (this will not hold true if I am 'underground' .... err 'hiding'... errr... NOT BROADCASTING + HIDING + TOR + ANON ETC. not to be confused with underground/hiding + BROADCASTING)
I will live shame free (hopefully)


I will be a rally point of code
of ideas and knowledge


Who's is the anonymity authority?
none exist
by definition they cannot exist.

but I can make one somewhat exist
I can be my own authority
I can teach others to be anonymous

warn them of the paranoia, but let them decide if it's a door they would like to open

I can teach them to do both simultaneously, like I'm willing to bet I will decide to do. Multiple monitors.


I want everything to be documented and replicatable.
That is science.

In a sense, I am devoting my life to science.
In another, to art.

But if you asked me, I'd say that I'm doing whatever sounds the most fun.
This sounds the most fun.
The most free.
The most rewarding.
The most well spent.
I'm going to die.
