Two main todo lists: micro and macro.
Micro is filled with anything and processed entirely by me. It is free will etc.
Macro is running businesses etc. It is mostly delegating tasks. I don't necessarily process this todo list, but I "make sure the tasks get performed"... so in a sense I do process it xD (the same way a CEO of a company makes a product etc).

In line with wanting randomness for variety, I should rig a PRNG up to the macro list and do random ass fucking tasks from it. They can be "sub-tasks" and probably will be, because I'd imagine most of the things on the macro todo list would be pretty large. I want to jump in and do semi-small micro sub-macro tasks at random. It will be not only for my amusement, but also to learn new things. No matter what subject/area-of-expertise, I will make at least some effort to learn it. Maybe some day I'll install a conveyer belt in my house or some such (random fucking example). But I mean, I can obviously balk at any selected task ("pass/next") or or even decline to do a random micro-sub-task ("not now"). I can get them handed to me on demand, but they should be given to me at a random ass fucking interval. Maybe once a week (configurable "defaults d3faults defaults default d3faults dht sync'd BLAH BLAH BLAH").

This has to do with the "colonel randomly parachuting out" doc, but in this one I create the concept of a "macro todo list". In fact the micro list doesn't even have the colonel randomly parachuting out... since I do all those tasks myself anyways. If an item were to jump ahead like that, it would simple be being re-prioritized because of free will.
