An aspiring hacker things "oh, to have a system littered with scripts. a script for every task". At some point in BECOMING a hacker, you realize: the unix philosophy "do one thing really well" already buys that for you. You already have a system littered with scripts, you just don't know how to use them yet. The key realization point is when you realize that there are infinite arguments you could provide to those hypothetical scripts [for every task] (that you think you want to code yourself). Realizing this, you finally realize that knowing the various arguments to the tools already present on your system is really what you wanted. You can't script infinite arguments (well I mean you could but wtf utility would that have when you want to invoke just ONE of those [sets of] arguments specifically?).
