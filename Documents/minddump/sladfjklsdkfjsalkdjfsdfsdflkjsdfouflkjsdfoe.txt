the fact that something can be true means that it has to be true [whether in another bang instance and/or this one is irrelevant]
this is a consequence of infinity
everything within the realm of physics (which MIGHT be too low of a ceiling, but i think it helps to understand and *might* be a good measure) is happening somewhere else
but this is happening here
and now
if there isn't more to the universe than our spherical explosion of "rocks" beyond it's borders (i guess more rocks?), i think it would be a safe bet (or reasonable expectation) that we are the only "animals" that have managed to evolve. earth's factors aren't impossible to replicate, but if a scholar or mathematician told me they crunched some numbers and that earth's factors are much more unlikely to be seen twice in a set of [the count/size/(mass?) of all the "rocks" (lol typo: rockets) in our sphere]
calculating the factors is definitely possible but i don't think the formula has been attempted and i do have proof that it can be calculated -- that it is EXECUTING is proof that it can be "calculated" (we are chemical reactions). we are it's execution
