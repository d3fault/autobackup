it all comes down to gamblers theory
more or less
betting on "odds" and all that bullshit
do i bet on INFINITY
or do i bet on "plausibility"

everything is plausible
infinity is in... (indefinine? infinite? lol wut?)



do i choose to bet on infinity?
or the insane odds against me?


i really
technically
THEORETICALLY
(if infinity really exists)
don't even have to worry
even the slightest fucking bit
about assassination


but i practically
most probably
(if death really exists)
have to worry
my motherfucking ass off
about death coming prematurely





which side do i take?
a coin flip won't help me at all.
i must decide
i am searching for the logic
but i (now) know the logic isn't there



kaylee
single

life
assassination



those are both it
both depend entirely on infinite multiverse theory






i can reject and hide from it
or i can accept and embrace it
F34RL3SS




fuck. i really don't know what to do.
i wish i did.
but id ont'................
fuck
i keep hoping that i'll submble upon the logical solution. but i am computerly oncompetent



i am leaning back
i have been leaning back
in my chair
with my eyes closed
my head is leaning against the "manager" size chair
i am wrirint
i am thinking
i saw that typo but was unable to correct it (without opening my eyes)


rememberin how amny depths of parenthesi ssssssss you areis quite difficu8lt when you are unable to SEEEEEEE
or even       if you can see but cannot..... count tem easily
becauese the "open parenthesis" is... are spread out.... and can't be counted easily...
but thtec close parenthesis tend to be aligned so they are eeaiser to count. fuck this document i have no idea where i am going


i woke up and and looked at the screen right around "where i am going"
and it just seemed... surreal
cliche
etc
w/e
to know that i am typing
to be typing
to comprehend typing

was a miniscule moment of bliss




i am almost there

i will be weird
i will be insane
i will be rejected
i will be on the brim of society
i will be an outsider
whatever you want to call it
I WILL BE FULL BLAST
i will be myself.
i will not compromsie


if you are a family member of friend and do not wish to become butthurt: do not speak to me
