breathe polling

while watching TV with a cellphone in your pocket
your reaction is conveyed via the way you breathe
your phone's mic can pick up on it
(or at the very least, modern cutting edge (2012) mics can)
the commercials are modified realtime based on whether or not you like them
they could even ask you questions, in a sense
"polling"
