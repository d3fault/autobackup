"umm" is an acknowledgement. People often say that those who say "umm" are stupid because "umm" isn't a word and doesn't mean anything. I disagree [with the claim that it doesn't mean anything (and it could be made a "real" word)]. Saying "umm" essentially says "I heard what you said/requested, and I am thinking about it (and usually/probably a response to it)". Without the "umm" ack, the other person is likely to assume you didn't hear them and to then repeat themselves. Afaik, there's no short/quick way to say "I heard you and I'm processing it". The word "umm" fills that gap. So fuck you, grammar nazis, let's make "umm" an "official" word.
