input obstructs output
being in an output only mode means your output is pure
it is merely you
receiving input can completely throw you off track. make you lose your train of thought entirely
sometimes it is GOOD (collaboration), a lot of the times it isn't (distraction)

"freedom from distraction" should be a human right
dmca notices are a distraction
so are ceep notices
freedom to collaborate should obviously be one too...
but eh perhaps it's best if we keep only important/vital "freedoms" in the list
i mean that we should be able to derive both of those freedoms from a freedom that covers both, if one exists
minimize the "freedoms" and stick to it + all derivatives)

it's so weird how "can't threaten the president" completely contradicts "freedom of speech"
it's weird because i acknowledge and understand fully WHY we need to have it
but it is a blatant contradiction of "freedom of speech"
we should rewrite it to "freedom of opinion"
since threats and "instruction manuals" can be illegal -_-
we should just... NOT LIE
tell it like it is
it definitely ISN'T "freedom of speech"


in a sense it is proof that the government has brainwashed us
it's very minimal proof, but proof none-the-less
"freedom of speech" SOUNDS NICE... and hell may have even been what the "founding fathers" wanted... but it sure as shit isn't what we have now. oh look i've countered my own argument: it isn't a conspiracy because the truth is the government just hasn't gotten around to changing it. still, it should be changed because it's wrong
