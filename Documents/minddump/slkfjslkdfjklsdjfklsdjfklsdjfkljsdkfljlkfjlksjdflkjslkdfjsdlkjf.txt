I want to be:
  a sex slave
, a serial killer
, committed
, on welfare (with agenda)
, dead
, in hyper bliss.
But most of all, I want my current path (music fingers etc) to succeed (and it depends entirely on me).


When you're born into a world where every molecule is CLAIMED, and you need molecules to survive, and the only way to get molecules is to give your time to your peers who were born before you (in exchange for molecules), you're born into slavery. You have three options: be a slave, kill someone and take their molecules, or try to change the system. The first two options suck, so I'm defaulting to the third.

I finally have a strategy for trying to change the system.
