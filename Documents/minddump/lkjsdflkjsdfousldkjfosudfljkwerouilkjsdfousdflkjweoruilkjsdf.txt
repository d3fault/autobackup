I do think math can show/prove/demonstrate that p2p economy is more viable and better for overall human sanity etc. I can't do the math but I'm pretty sure it can be done. It'll either "click" for me someday and I'll make some fucking charts etc.... or someone else will do the math/arguing for me :-D. Thank you for your services, whoever you are.



Just need some kind of analogy.... and I'm thinking grains of sand will work.... but meh I suck too much at math haha. I can theorize it and be quite confident I am right, but I can't formalize it :(.
