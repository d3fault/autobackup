this is an instance. the timeline that the timeline-chairlift is carrying
the timeline chairlift is merely the coordinates in time
we have an atomic clock, so one should be used in the coding
the precision should be scalable and perhaps even auto-scalable
either way, atomicity isn't hard to represent in code!
