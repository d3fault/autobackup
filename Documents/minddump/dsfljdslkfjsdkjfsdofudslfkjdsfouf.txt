robots means we can not have to rip each others' time off
that is all capitalism is doing. it encourages us to rip each other's time off
boosting creativity simultaneously
it does the job that our brains do not need it to do [once robots are created that can perform life surviving duties automatically with periodic maintenance acceptable]
we don't need incentive to create because the method being used is inciting us to rip each other off
our incentive to create is always better when we approach it with a free intention, or more specifically: not trying to (having to!) rip each other off
i support solving world hunger and i approve of [temporary until space occupying] forced reproduction control
except at the same time i think it's one of the most in-humane things ever
it is most likely going to become a necessity once robots are figured out
