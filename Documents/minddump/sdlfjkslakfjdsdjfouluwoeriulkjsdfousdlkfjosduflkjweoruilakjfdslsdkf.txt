There are infinite vector frames in one second and there is also one. How many you use depends entirely on the technology of your day. How many you perceive depends entirely on the technology of your day (errr, in the evolution sense this time haha). Humans really only need roughly 30fps... and 60fps is a nice max (ok 100 if you really want to argue about it (who gives a shit)).
