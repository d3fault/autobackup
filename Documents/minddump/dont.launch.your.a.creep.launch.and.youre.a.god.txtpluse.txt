the appearance of my entire life is pretty much solely based on me launching
in one i'm just like a creep with some weird ideas
in another i'm a god


ROFL
i do agree
even if i fail
i'm still a god by comparison
in comparison to silence
which is what this is
even though you are typing.
since you do not release the world cannot react
so you do it for their reactions?
i don't
so fuck the world
shit
err i mean yes
(?????????)
wtf am i talking about?

if you do not release you are vulnerable to being ripped off, paranoia, shame, becoming corrupt yourself, and starving to death. haha that was cool how i just used the opposites. hmm do those bare greater significance
