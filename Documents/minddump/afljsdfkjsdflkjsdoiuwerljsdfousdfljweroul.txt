When using an async 'quit' message + flagging, I could simultaneously set up a timer that times out after a second or two. Each backend that [asynchronously] reports itself as quit'd flips a boolean, then when that timer times out we see which backends have NOT flipped their boolean (haven't quit'd) and can then spit out a debug message saying which particular backend it is. If the backends all quit before the timer times out, the timer is deleted and never does time out. fuck it. the application ends (or at least that chunk of code). wait()'ing blocks the gui, and we have to use a synchronous 'quit' message i think. no actually i am wrong. you can use an ASYNC quit (don't call quit, send a custom slot message startQuit() or whatever), THEN wait()... or just start that timer. idfk
