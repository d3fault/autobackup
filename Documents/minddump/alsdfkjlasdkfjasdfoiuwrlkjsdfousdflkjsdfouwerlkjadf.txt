I realized moments after turning on my voice recorder during dinner that I speak more/differently when I know I'm being recorded

err I mean yea the fbi is always listening...

...but when I have my recorder in my pocket, I speak more and form my words more correctly.


I am not afraid to speak my mind because I know I will capture it and it won't just be jacked/forgotten.


This is the state I want to live in.



I would have never said "i was just washing my hands"
it felt weird saying~
that was when I realized it
