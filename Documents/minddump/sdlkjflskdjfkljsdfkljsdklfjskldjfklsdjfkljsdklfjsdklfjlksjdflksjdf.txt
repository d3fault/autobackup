Maybe I can get a job as one of those sign holding guys. Wear my rig and dance and code...

Oh just realized that really I ALREADY AM one of those sign holding guys. ABC is basically that (except for teh internets, not a street corner).


Still, in the shorter term, I may need to dance on a street corner instead of [just] in-my-room/on-the-internet. In all honesty, it makes no difference (rather, very little difference (UV rays ffffff (++sunscreen;))), as long as my mind is on code/music/etc.

The plan fails completely since they want you to spin the sign with your hands.

I guess you could say I'm losing confidence. My business plan wasn't sociopathic enough. lel. This next month will tell.
