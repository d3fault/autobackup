christian control

I have written this before but in a different context and I believe I was getting at something slightly different.


Christians claim to "submit to a larger power" (God) and blab about faith and all this non-sense. They claim that God is in control and they submit to him and have faith in him.

Yet they also claim to have free will and that their actions on earth dictate whether they go to heaven or hell. <- This _IS_ control. They do in fact have control, they just delude themselves using silly fancy sounding failogic (tm) to make it sound like they are "surrenduring themselves to god". It makes them sound like they're better people or whatever.

We agnostics (had:atheists) know we are semi in control (free will) and semi not in control (chaos). Sure you have to submit to chaos, but the difference is basically just accuracy. Submitting to God and submitting to Chaos are essentially the same thing... sans delusional beliefs about an invisible man in the sky watching you masturbate.

Meh tearing down Christian arguments is too easy and pretty much a waste of time... until I remember that stupidity is the enemy.
