re: me sitting on the computer 24/7/365
i'd rather be lonely 1% of the time than bored 99% of the time

implying people bore me ;-) (most do)
i think i may have written this already but i forget. it's worth the dupe
duuuuuude
how many dupes am i going to have once i'm old as fuck and senile n shit? (HELLO OLD AND SENILE STEVEN DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER WRITING THIS? ANOTHER THOUGHT I HAD TODAY WAS IF I WOULD EVEN FEEL LIKE I AM THE SAME PERSON 50+ YEARS FROM NOW. SEEMS LIKE SUCH A LONG TIME. WOULD I BE ABLE TO LOOK BACK AT VIDEOS OF MYSELF NOW AND SAY "i am that person. i have not [mentally] changed" (with wrinkles and whatnot, because i obviously can't stop physical change)



then again, 'stopping mental change' is a stupid goal. i want to become smarter. but i don't want to be less of a free thinker...
