can't you do an empty, or at least relatively empty (1 txt file), git clone of a bare binary repo... just to get yourself in a position so that you can push into it?

it might also be possible to re-build/generate/whatever the FOLDER structure (only)

it's probably not possible.


git clone depth 1 has nothing to do with working dir
there is a command in clone to tell it to not set up the working dir
aka, it said something like 'do not check out the working dir after cloning'
so the clone just populates the .git folder
the checkout is what you're thinking of
but by then, ALL of the [latest, as per depth 1] files have already been copied into .git


....so nvm
