Did love stem from guilt? That clone came out and somehow the clone-ee felt the urge (zeros and ones told him to do so) to help his clone survive? Probably a start of critical thinking as well. "HOW can I help him/it?". I feel like I've written this infinite times before (but I also feel like I've written something similar in this bang instance/life too)
