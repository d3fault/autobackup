Not leaving this house definitely negatively affecting my life (with respect to caydon). He asked me when he got home from school if I'd go on a walk with him. I said yes thinking my mom wasn't going. When I found out she was I backed out. I have a new rule as of the other day: I'm not leaving until I launch and am secure (I will build my security during launch (incl. fingers, a single LAYER of that security (but also much much much much much more))). There is also my grandfather and of course many friends and other family members. This is shit but I do feel it's necessary. I am letting paranoia get the best of me, but it is for the goal of security! It is also not permanent (hopefully, otherwise I am eating a shotgun).
