Humans (myself definitely included) tend to see negatives as definite facts, and positives as possible facts. As an example (the claim is the same on both sides): Negative/definite-fact: "I want to die. But I can't, there are inifinite universes and in at least one of them I always decide not to commit suicide" -- Positve/possible-fact: "I want to live fearlessly, but I'm unsure whether or not there are infinite universes, so and living fearlessly hinges on there being infinite".


I want to get a lobotomy and become a christian. Semi-OT(christians have "ignorance is bliss" first and foremost, but...): It sucks that there's such a high correlation between nice girls and dumb/christian girls, especially since their niceness is sincere.
