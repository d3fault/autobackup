i decided a few days ago that i will allow myself to live without restraint as much as i want
since i am justifying censorship, i can justify anonymous activity. bluebox, ANYTHING.

the only exception to ANYTHING is: anything that they might find and then refuse to revive me over
which is pretty much synonymous with: anything they'll give me the death penalty for


so like copyright violation or even theft: i am allowed to do

however i have no theft in mind.... mainly just giant copyright violation :-D. bluebox sounds fun to do.
i can justify that online coding of the video component to coincide and be used with the online video broadcast/launching
but, you know, make the pieces fit oh so perfectly that my hidden/anonymous persona can slide them into place

obviously this extends far beyond just video



i told myself that i'd need serious self-control if i were to do it
and i am not entirely sure i have said self-control


i am not sure i even want to do it
it's a slippery slope and could lead to excess paranoia

i think trying to be as close to 100% as possible will get me closest to bliss
and i won't ever be afraid of leaking data either. there won't be a secret side to me


still, i can/will allow it.



if i do it, i have to do it before i launch (unless i go offline mid-launch, something i do not plan to do)
otherwise they'd know or suspect that i'm up to something


meh idfk. it all sounds FUN but then i talk myself out of it too. gah


even killing and raping sounds fun... but i think/know if i did that that my chances of immortality become zero
