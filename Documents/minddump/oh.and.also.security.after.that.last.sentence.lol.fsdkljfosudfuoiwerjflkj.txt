Obama after my hypothetical death: "we should have better guarded this natural treasure". holy shit i meant to write "national" but then was also going to add how it isn't a good word (world? universe? etc), but that typo is actually fucking perfect. I don't want to die and be the guy that they beef up security AFTERWARD to learn from mistakes etc. What am I talking about anyways, security for everyone? It part of the government? Actually I'm happy to say that it could be put on the ballots. 'Murica means we can do anything. So long as it is voted in. So I guess we do have "freedom to *", it's just that it has to first be put to a vote (very easy to "tread new waters" and self-navigate with humanly-deduced "morals" (shit isn't hard at all to deduce. whether or not you agree with the morals is irrelevant)). there is also a growing blacklist :( fml. that words are on it is fucking stupid. (lol ironic that i cussed in that sentence (actually not ironic, just funny)). I would indeed enjoy seeing automated lives for everyone but with engaging and stimulating "helping"/teaching/or-even-just-suggesting-random-items-on-your-todo-list(s)-etc and our entire existences being no longer monetarily [something].
