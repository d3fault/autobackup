My disability is balance. The fallacy that will maybe/probably/???? get me killed is: "since any security measure can be compromised, I shouldn't use security" (speaking about physical persons security). I'm either ultra fucking paranoid or not paranoid at-all/enough. The moment I devote a portion of my brain to security, I instantly become ultra fucking paranoid and would then proceed to waste my entire fucking life "securing". At least by not being secure at all, I get to enjoy my life for those 10 seconds after I launch before someone shoots me in fucking face with a sniper rifle.

A solution: outsource physical security. I get to enjoy life... but then I'd be "trusting <them>".... which actually may or may not be better than trusting no one and not trying (probably is better (only case where it wouldn't be better is for those cases where teh bad guyz (hurr) only want to defeat the security measures BECAUSE THEY ARE THERE)).
