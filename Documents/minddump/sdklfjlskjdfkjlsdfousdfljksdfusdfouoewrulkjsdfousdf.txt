re: Love is infinite; so is evil and hate.

Love attracts, evil and hate repell. Evil/hate can attract fellow evil/hate, but for the most part it repells everything.

Cheesy as it all is (indeed, life itself is quite cheesy)... it's true.


My desire to kill/rape/shit-on-your-face are very real and I won't mentally deny them the ability to live in my brain. I will acknowledge them (had: I won't dis-a[???]), but using logic and math alone I will suppress them from ever leaving my brain (except in harmless words, of course (fuck the police)).


My desire to kill/rape and my logical suppression of it
IS THE SAME THING AS (or is similar to)
My fear of death and my logical suppression of it


It's just that there is empirical evidence to support the suppressing of the desire to kill/rape, whereas there's a gargantuan(sp) amount of false positive "empircal" (quotes because false positive) evidence for suppressing your fear of death (or at least, logic tells me this is true (could be false, I know nothing! (<- aww shit "I know nothing" is that same paradox ;-P, except not relevant at all))).



Ahh, but I contradict myself! If I choose love because hate/evil push away, then why do I then go on to say that a fear of death isn't necessary [so long as you are willing to sacrifice your environment]? Sans Environment == Isolated (just like evil/hate... but not including it). So for me to choose love because I don't want to be isolated, I should then also choose to protect my environment at all costs (sanity) for the very same reason.


HOLY SHIT INSANITY IS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE SPECTRUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Love everyone, protect your environment at all costs (ULTRA PARANOID MODE ENGAGE) = insane (though at least not alone ;-P)
[Hate everyone and be evil], accept environmental consequences that a lack of fear of death costs you = alone = insane

Note that hate/evil is in square brackets, which has a programmer meaning of "optional".



HURR:
SURELY THERE MUST BE AN OPTIMAL BALANCE



fffffffffffffffff


I want to explain that " = alone = insane" part. It _IS_ the "conscience in a void" I'm always going on about. To live in it, and it ONLY, is insanity. There is nothing for you to do in there. We need our environments to give us chaos/etc to keep us amused. Going into, or becoming, a conscience in a void (meditation || tripping balls), helps you understand who/what you are (you are nobody, but you are 'something'). It can help you set goals in life (by first making you understand that all goals are pointless (and then making you accept that)). It can help you find/create meaning (by making you understand that all meaning is created (tempted to put "found/" but eh idk lol (surely meaning can be re-created, so does that count?)) in life.


OT but just remembered it: As time approaches infinity, the probability that a human will re-[think|create|invent|express] a [respective piece of information] approaches 100%. Time _IS_ approaching infinity, therefore all patents/etc are illegal.


I guess everything said and done I remember that I don't have love; I already am more or less in a void and eh I want to get some coding done here because it's one of the only things I enjoy. My parents/Caydon/dog/cat are fucking distractions and they suck me out of it and make me miserable (despite me being MOSTLY ok with them in general). Blah I won't whine [again], I'm trying to process this logic (again, infinitely). I'm trying to decide what to do. I'm trying to decide how to behave. I'm trying to decide if/what I should censor.


This doc stands out to me because I never considered that insanity were on both sides of the equation. A thought that came to mind a few days ago: thousands/millions/whatever years from now I can look back on my own life and think: "how pathetic. I emerge into existence and the only thing I can think to do is obsessive compulsively organize the fuck out of it" (programming, logic, knowledge, etc (tempted to remove the word knowledge here BECAUSE IT IS QUITE NECESSARY FUCKER but idfk)). Perhaps insanity is where we start AND where we end (thousands/millions years from now). Maybe boredom isn't the problem after all. ALTHOUGH arguably, boredom and insanity are the same thing :). Alive infinitely, nothing [new] to do.... BLAST YOURSELF and start over (everything becomes new). Insanity or boredom.... it's just semantics at that point who gives a shit.

I guess that kind of summarizes why I want to make music. Coding is fun in the same way that a puzzle game is: stimulates your mind and shit. BUT it isn't really doing anything at all at the end of the day. Music isn't either, but it's still........ OOOOMMMMFFFF. It's still...... gah, wordless. Art? Living? A bite of life. Sugar on the tongue. 5-MEO-DMT in the brain. A special chemical reaction (music->emotion (o btw even more happy about "i feel music" [when tripping balls] after writing that (those two))). Random/Semi-OT: sounds (and accidental (and eventually purposeful) music) could be the "main" driving force for the evolution/emergence of emotion (we don't know that it isn't). A counter-argument to that is that deaf people still have emotion, but the counter to that counter is that their ancestors weren't necessarily deaf.
