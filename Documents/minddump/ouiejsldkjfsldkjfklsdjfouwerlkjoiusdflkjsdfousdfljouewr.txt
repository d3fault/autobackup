Every human expression (thought, emotion, etc) is more valuable than gold, but most humans don't value then nearly as much as gold because human expressions aren't as scarce (or shiny ;-P).

Two lols:
1) lack-of-value is also an expression O_o. The humans thinking 'the gold is more valuable than human expression' is itself an expression, so that thought (although disagreed with by this particular thinker) is itself more valuable than gold. Almost appeared to be a contradiction, but isn't.
2) human expression used to be more scarce than gold. we can create tons more of both. so the statement in first sentence is really only valid relatively (valid in 2014 on earth)

..thought about changing it from gold to diamonds (more rare), but gold rolls off the tongue better (and who cares really)..
