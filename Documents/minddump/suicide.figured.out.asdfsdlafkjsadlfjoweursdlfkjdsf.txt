i want to commit suicide
i really do
but as soon as i decide to, i stop being that instance of being. instance of the universe. single universe out of the multiverse. i am unable to kill myself because one of me always wills his way through it. survival is the only answer. but ok i still think i'm going to die. fine. old age may be unsolvable [for the time being]. EITHER WAY, live your fucking ass off because: you just got here. you're brand fucking new. welcome to existence. thanks old me <3, i'll try to 'have some fun' ?.
