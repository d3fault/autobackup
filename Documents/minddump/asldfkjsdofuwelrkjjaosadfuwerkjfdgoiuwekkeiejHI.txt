there is no such thing as suicide
because in order to analyze the concept of suicide
you must first be alive

you cannot "leave" this realm
you cannot die

it is and always will be
reincarnation or no
your conscience will never experience death
because in death, your conscience does not exist

if you kill yourself
if(reincarnation)
{
  you reappear as a child instantly
}
else


... there is no else
you cease to process
there is no return 0
there is no exception thrown
the entire universe ceases to exist
your perspective of it
which is all you have

suicide is not a way out
any problem you might have, someone else (or you in their form) will have to face
so you might as well be the one to face it
obviously we all can't just suicide at every problem we encounter

the concept of suicide sounds so appealing
black screen
but i just don't see the point of it
i want relief
basically
but it isn't relief
it's nothing
you have to be alive in order to feel relief

only success can bring relief
forge a path through this bullshit code
you can do better
