nothing matters and everything matters simultaneously makes deciding impossible



i was taking a piss after looking at myself in the mirror and shooting myself in the head with my two fingers
and contemplating suicide, as usual
i pictured myself walking to the shotgun and just ending it all
i knew in alternate universes i made that decision
i knew in this one i hadn't
i exercised my "always in the non-suicidal split" theory

my eyes began to water
i almost began to cry

but i might be missing the reason why
or maybe that was it


but right around this time i looked back at the mirror and muttered the top line
it's true

i should be wreckless
and i should care

everything is pointless because everybody and everything will die
but everything matters because there is nothing else


it's both depressing and liberating

cognitive dissonance lately has been eating me up
it's better to comprehend and accept the dissonance
than to sit here scratching my head
wasting my life away

do
SOMETHING
anything.
it doesn't matter
but it does
simultaneously

what you do does not matter
enjoy it.
that you do something
ANYTHING
matters entirely
because otherwise you're wasting it

it being this consciousness

sure i'll come back
but i won't be me
it won't be now
it will be then

even if i'm here again
the time will be different

because it will be a different reference point relative

time is linear
there is no backwards and forwards

yes everything can repeat itself
and everything DOES repeat itself
i CAN get to this same exact train of thought again after the universe collapses and re-"bang"s
but that will be in the future

....and yes... i could have (and therefore HAVE HAVE (lol bad wording)) been here before
but that was in the past

this is right now
i am alive right now
and i have free will right now

nothing else matters

use it or don't
if you don't it also doesn't matter
but if you do...
...and you use it unwisely
that doesn't matter either

what does matter....
is.. if you succeed

this time

because you clearly didn't before.
and if you don't now
maybe you will next time

but this IS next time

AND IT IS PREVIOUSLY

because relative to me
there is only ever NOW

i cannot differentiate because i am not around before or after
only now

and my train of thought is the exact same
every single time


does that mean i can never succeed?
does that mean i should introduce random'ness to change it up in the hopes of success?
is randomness even possible?

i flip a coin exactly the same in every instance
every universal instantiation

so while it may appear random, it isn't.

no
fuck randomness

randomness works (proven by the fact that we/i exist in human form)

but randomness also takes time

should i strive for the best??

instinctively i say yes

because i'm bound to reach success

but i also believe that that's exactly what i do every time
and fail (evident by the fact that i'm here right now)

but if i enjoy trying
it does not matter

those emotions released
'enjoy'
whatever that is
that's what you live for

accept your defeat
and enjoy enjoying

try for success if you enjoy trying
but don't waste your life striving for perfection if it makes you miserable
it probably doesn't matter
in fact i'm pretty sure it doesn't matter
UNLESS
success is possible
which is as of yet unproven (evident by the fact that i'm here right now... unsuccessful)
but that doesn't mean it isn't possible either
just that i haven't tried hard enough
or maybe i just focus too much on enjoying instead of trying
see the dissonance bleeding through?
fml.


i think i've found a good combo
i call it... 'launch'

it's both what i want out of life
and it is considered trying by my own definition

most likely scenario: i am frozen and woken up later and we succeed

what part do i play?
eh just coding
expanding communication
a demonstration of a free mind

if i die i don't give a shit

but if i can set a better example and then freeze myself
(and also code the tools to help ;-P)
then maybe someday i can be woken up out of being frozen and we can live infinitely

short term infinitely might suffice (death at universal collapse)
but the ultimate success is to evade the collapse
and to live infinitely infinitely (not implying there's a difference. you get the idea)
