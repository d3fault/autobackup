I'm standing near the edge of a tall cliff in samurai battle attire. My sword is just hitting the ground after slicing perfectly in half (top-down) a human-sized stick of string cheese. The half of string cheese that falls down the cliff with rag doll physics says "EXPRESSION" on it, and there are many other scattered/forgotten/EXPRESSION string cheese halves at the bottom of the cliff awaiting their freshly sliced brother to join them. The other half of the string cheese, "IDEA", remains rigid and is collected and stacked neatly in an outdoor made-from-3-to-5-inch-diameter-sticks-like-a-cabin-sorta (or like that lucid dream I had once and walked towards something similar (started at the top of a building and had red beams downward /ref)) shed thing (no front door on it), on top of and alongside various other IDEAs. In the background, there is a house.
