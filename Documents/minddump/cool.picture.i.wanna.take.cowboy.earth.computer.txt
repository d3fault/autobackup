a picture of me riding my computer like a bull with a lasso and maybe a cowboy hat (decide when you do it), spinning the shit overhead. will be hard to get a perfect capture need a fast shutter but it'll look awesome. oh and i'm trying to catch a globe sitting on the floor in front of me. my eyes are staring directly at the globe and my face is ????? idk what facial expression. maybe smiling? smirking? decide when you do it.
