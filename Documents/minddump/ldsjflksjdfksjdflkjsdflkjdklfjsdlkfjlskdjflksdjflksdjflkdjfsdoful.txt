Distributed Slavery

Same thing as wage slavery. Both slaves and employees are compensated. Slaves are compensated with not dying, food, and shelter. Employees are compensated with money for food and shelter (necessary for not dying).

I'm only focusing on the distribution/submission-pyramid that is the free market, since it involves the majority of the population. The majority of the population spends the majority of their lives working: what a bullshit system.

Employers try to pay their employees as little as possible. Minimize costs, maximize profits. They are always attempting to approach the point where at will employment is the same as slavery (where your compensation is merely not dying, food, and shelter). A counter-argument to this is that you are free to leave and go somewhere else, but every employer has that same goal. Leaving also temporarily drastically increases your chances of death from starvation.

Innovate, submit, or die.
