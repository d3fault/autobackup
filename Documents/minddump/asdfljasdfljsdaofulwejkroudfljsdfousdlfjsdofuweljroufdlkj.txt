I stare at my transparent 'Terminal' with my desktop in sight, mplayer is playing daft punk -- too long. i understand every character on screen. further, i understand the threading / byte exchanging/streaming occuring underneath. i am not an expert on compression/codecs (or math in general), but i don't need to be. understanding every character on my screen brings me to a restful state. i stare at that screen (the transparency is key :-P) until i think of a new document to write.

i am a knowledge junky. this is certainly not a bad addiction.
