Can't even sit in my chair listening to music with headphones on and my screen unlocked and lean my head back and close my eyes... without my door locked. Always think my mom'll come in hear quietly (I listen to headphones loud ofc) and look at my screen! Blah fuck secrets, but well, you know (refraining till launch)...
