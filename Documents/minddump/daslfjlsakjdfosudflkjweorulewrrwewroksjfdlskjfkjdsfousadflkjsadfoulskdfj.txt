I think I'll raise the bar for weird a bit. But actually I was thinking the exact opposite just yesterday when watching the Life of Brian. Those cooky religious dudes on the stages next to Brian have me beat. I wouldn't doubt at all that people like that have, and maybe even still do, exist. I think I have a lot more sound logic than them though. I'm smart-weird. I'm basically just normal but ahead of my time... that's how I see it (yeh yeh arrogant/pompous etc STFU).
