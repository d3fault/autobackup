if my "musically induced new thoughts/works are transformative, not derivative" case fails
then it is ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY that i erect a LIBRE-net (there are already others, but none i control~)

life is finite
time alive is short
you can't expect me to PAUSE my "proprietary works" just to be able to speak/think
listen to a 5 minute song, pause, speak for 5 minutes
you've now halved your free time in your life, gg
FUCK THAT SHIT

A work should be LIBRE by default
derivative works have just as much value as transformative works
when i said "there isn't enough room in this intellectual bubble", i was half right. i need to elaborate
it's so stuffy in this media-driven society that it becomes hard to make transformative works. it is much easier to make derivative works
derivative works are still incredibly valuable
int main { cout << "hello world" << endl; } could be the original works
and an entire fucking OS/app can be the derivative of it
that's obviously an extreme example, but a valid example nonetheless




i didn't realize until recently just how AMAZING copyleft is
copyleft harnesses the "fair use" 4-point balancing mechanism
a works published that is a derivative of a proprietary works that is NOT fair use... becomes ILLEGAL CONTENT
i don't really understand what happens to it to be honest
the idea of "illegal content" just sounds silly
the author of the derivative does not have the right to distribute it
does he even have the right to look at it on his own computer?
it's just silly. this reality is bullshit :-P

HOWEVER, when a derivative (proprietary or not, but proprietary makes a better example!) fails the "fair use" test, that proprietary works becomes LIBRE!!! huuuuge win
it's like stealing content into the domain of "libre" :-D
amazing
they can't "unpublish" it because they're butthurt it's not proprietary any longer
it's too late by then!
the proprietary work magically transforms into a libre work
(whether or not the source is available is a different story, but reverse engineering it now becomes legal too!)
