A work released as poem is copyrightable.
A song released cannot copyright it's lyrics (or something?? Lyrics are free to copy/paste across websites).
Are not lyrics a poem?
Copyright law is fucking stupid.


What if the poem is released first (with all right reserved copyright) and then the song utilizing it later (same author)? Are those lyrics now copyright infringement if they are distributed on lyrics sites?
