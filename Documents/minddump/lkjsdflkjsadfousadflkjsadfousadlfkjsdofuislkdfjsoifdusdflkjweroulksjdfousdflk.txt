Sex without love is like drugs without intelligence. Sure it's fun, but there's much more to be had. I admit I searched desparately through my mind to find the "drugs without intelligence (or knowledge) counterpart". The "sex without love is like..." half was dangling for a bit. There are probably plenty of comparisons.
