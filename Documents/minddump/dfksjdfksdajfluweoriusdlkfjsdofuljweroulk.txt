i tend to write :-/ and :-P in place of :-( and :-) respectively whenever i am putting either of the two in a sentence that is about to be followed by a close parenthesis.

so, i'd put: (yay this sentence makes me happy :-P) instead of (yay this sentence makes me happy :-))
etc, same for :-/ and :(

the reasons are obvious lololololololol (visually speaking), but there's also the UNMATCHED PARENTHESIS COUNT reason to boot
