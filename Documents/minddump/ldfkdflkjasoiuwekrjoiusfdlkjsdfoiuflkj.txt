a typo in software controlling "machines that can print + assemble + activate themselves" could cause an infinite loop to seriously fuck up some real life shit. especially if they are auto-harvesting. i'm talking about with no AI whatsoever. we'd probably be in better shape if there was _ANY_ AI (some dumb AI solves this, some ACTUAL AI obviosly does too (unless the AI is malicious)). just dumb and poorly-formed software
the machines build themselves at an exponential rate
so that is HYPOTHETICALLY how fast they could "dig up the earth and assemble it into more clones of itself"
which is ridiculously fast


AND NOW FOR SOME FUN MATH:


1m x 1m x1m self assembler
say it takes... 20 minutes to build and activate a clone of itself
and let's assume they set themselves right next to each other and don't spread out. there is no "defragging issue" in this (although there will be in a real situation)
actually for simplicity's sake i'm going to only calculate the width appropriate stuff.. and i'm going to measure it against the surface of the earth (whereas i was planning to do the volume initially... but meh)


damn i suck at math
staring at bc -_-


510072000=2^x lost idfk what to do






i could see this as a prank / hack that people might do in the future. the government/police will be forced to blow it up / otherwise destroy it (perhaps deactivate it electronically? (doing it without erasing the software would be ideal))
