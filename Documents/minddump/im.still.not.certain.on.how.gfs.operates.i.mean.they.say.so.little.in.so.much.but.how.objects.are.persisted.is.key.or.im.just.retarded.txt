the precise-as-fuck timestamps from the chunkservers are what the master uses to not-realtime organize the persisted timeline or whatever(????). if the timestamps happen to match (unlikely), they are sent ordered in the timeline persistence (it too is saved on the chunkservers?) in order of hash, alphabetically. with adequate salt, this should be sufficient (famous last words)
