The big 4.

Balance is not impossible, but a perfect balance is. Right now I am being pulled in 4 different directions. 1) How much time to spend with elders (parents, grandparents), 2) How much time to spend/invest in youngers (nephew is only one I can think of atm), 3) How much input to accept, 4) How much output to produce.


It is as if we are given 2 bathtubs, one scalding hot and the other freezing cold... and we are told to make ourselves comfortable. You can lay atop the middle of both so that your legs are in one and your toreso is in another.... but neither portion of your body will be entirely (remotely?) comfortable.


What's needed is a syphon so you can add cold to hot and hot to cold to balance them both out.




Does my d3fault/project-go-outside/dream/fingers thing serve as one? I am a fan of the "lead by example" mentality, so I justify to myself (even now) my concentration on output. Still, does the project introduce new concepts of interaction? Does it not allow me to interact with both my nephew and grandparents simultaneously, as well as to accept their (and/or others') input while still outputting my own (mute myself TO THEM AND MYSELF, but continue to output/think/"speak"). I don't know if this is just a desparate attempt for my brain to make it fit, or if it's as good as it sounds.

Regardless, it would be an improvement over where I am now (outputting to nobody).
