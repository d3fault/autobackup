the only way to have even a tiny bit of usable security is to use KEY FILES stored on a thumb drive (which are only ever connected to an output-only machine (or perhaps i mean input only? i am unsure tbh)) which is physically secured by keeping it in your anus. pickpockets can take shit from you with ease, etc.

the system in which you interact with must also be DELETE PROOF (dht etc), to account for the case where you are shot with a fucking tranquelizer dart and put to sleep and your key files are extracted


upon waking up with key files compromised, you do not have data loss and can mark at which point submissions are NOT yours by starting a new identity (which requires video communication/verification/something-like-that with a known friend... and perhaps multiple) and identifying new keyfiles (new systems entirely!)





there is still the vulnerability where you are held at gunpoint to pretend that everything is peachy. this is what having videocameras everywhere is intended to prevent
