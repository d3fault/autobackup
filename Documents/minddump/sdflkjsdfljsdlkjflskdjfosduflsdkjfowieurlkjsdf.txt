i've decided i need to launch for myself and my sanity. kaylee would need to join me, though she doesn't necessarily need to broadcast also and mimic. i don't think i would not launch for her (and i'm glad there isn't an ultimatum decision for that). i still don't know how it would work exactly, if i am filming my own sight and she is in it [and if she doesn't want to be filmed]. maybe i only do it for some hours a day? 8 hours a day? idfk. but yea i mean long term there will be a thing over my mouth so i can still speak whenever and not bother her etc. idfk, trying to contemplate/consider "launch + kaylee" is ridiculously hard, there are so many directions and factors and.... shit, idfk. i don't know how she'll react to it. i don't know how the whole world will react to it. maybe her + lots (or everyone) will join/mimic? it would be stupid to not launch, because i think she wants an awesome partner anyways. i'm glad there's no such thing as awesome-digging. and when i think of how pathetic i am NOW, and how awesome i'll be later, i really start to get excited and hope/wonder that she'll.... not necessarily change her mind... but SEEEEEEE! i'm pretty dumb for asking her so soon :-P, but i wanted to give her a chance [to say yes early on] ya know?

i was staring at my arduino + potentiometers and then when i processed the thoughts "my rpc generator problem is standing in between me and that", it really put things into perspective. i'm having a hard time.......... accepting(??)..... my............... 'fate' ?....... my destiny? i don't see myself as a showman etc. i think this is going to be silly. it will be silly. fuck it. it is about paranoia and others stuffs.
