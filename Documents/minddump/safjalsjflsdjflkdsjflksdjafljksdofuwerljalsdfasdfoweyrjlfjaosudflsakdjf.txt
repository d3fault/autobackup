Fancy Sentence:
My heartbeat is a clock cycle and my body is asynchronous.

Ok that aside, probably more accurately a single vectore frame in MY BRAIN is a single clock cycle.... but you know, I was sitting there watching the moving M.A.S.H. (irrlevant?) and feeling my heartbeat at the same time when I thought of it. Also I laughed hysterically for a good 60 seconds (incl. tears) after the cum pun.
