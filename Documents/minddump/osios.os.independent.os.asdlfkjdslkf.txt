osios (.com?)
OS independent OS
basically the d3fault "environment"
Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD, etc... (Qt)...
Reinvent windowing system (fuck it)
EGLFS (no-x) works seemlessly as OS, which is ADDITIONALLY standalone distribution (bsd because of DPL compatibility?)
All the others just have it as an app that has a "workspace" of windows, which are the apps (aka plugins (there is no difference, fuck the police))


basically i just like the acronym "OSIOS", it might even be better than "d3fault" (which of course will remain my name no matter what)


OSIOS (os/env) vs. d3fault (dht/etc) ??
aren't they one in the same??

so confus, especially when factoring in the non-dht earlier edition (ABC? wtf?)
