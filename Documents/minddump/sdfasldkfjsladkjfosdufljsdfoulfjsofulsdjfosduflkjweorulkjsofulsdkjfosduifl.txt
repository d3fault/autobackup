There is at least one of me and I am original at least once. The convenient ability of minimizing and "preparing for worst case scenario" type logic means I can/should/will/DO assume that this is the only one of me and that I am in fact original (fully admitting I may be wrong on both counts).

Still doesn't touch on the whole "should I fear death or forge forward because alternate universes I live on?", but DOES give me a stronger sense of free will. I am free will'ing this exact moment at least once.


Or of course only have deluded myself (PRNG thinks he's a RNG) of that fact. Good enough.


But I wonder..... can't a conscious CHOOSING operating system emerge on top of a PRNG of chemicals? I'm actually tempted to say yes to that. The PRNG stuff is like the prerequsite but the emergence of the OS is like a disconnected entity that lives within (or "on top of") it... and isn't bound to be deterministics like a PRNG is? IDFK.
