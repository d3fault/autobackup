If giving legal advice is illegal unless you're a lawyer (is it? I don't know AND POSSIBLY CAN'T EVEN SAY ;-)), and I want to "speak my thoughts", then it is illegal for me to think about the law. Whoa just thought of this and hadn't yet when deciding to write doc: How the fuck am I supposed to comply with the law if I am not legally able/allowed to think[/speak] about the law?

Logically, I overrule all the fucking idiot lawyers and judges in the entire US&A and can/should/will think[/speak] about law. Unjust and uncompliable law is unjust and unable to be complied with.


But eh perhaps my understanding of the law in respect to whether or not you can talk about law is off (lul). I think it's illegal to claim something is law if it isn't, or something. But is it illegal to think you're right and be wrong? I think that's why only lawyers can give law advice. Maybe that's where the line is drawn: "legal advice" is declared as such... but merely talking about law and giving unofficial legal advice HAS TO be legal (I'm not saying it _IS_ legal, I'm saying it _HAS TO_ be legal (fuck you eat shit and die <3)). Actually shit ima do some research on teh interbutts because everything I know about it was basically just inferred from seeing a bunch of "IANAL" posts xD.


I won't lie that I sort of want to be treading new ground here just because I hate lawyers and [most] judges and want to fucking troll them for fun. Hi!


I'm dumb, it's only illegal if you're claiming to be a lawyer.
