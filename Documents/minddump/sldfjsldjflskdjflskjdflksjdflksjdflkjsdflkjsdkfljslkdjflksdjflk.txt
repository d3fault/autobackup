I think my subconscience might be the most extroverted subconscience alive. Seriously, I've not seen anyone else's subconscience expressing them/it self so freaking much. All I need to do is write my damn dreams down, and viola, tons and tons of subconscious expression. I could even say "ignore everything my conscious self says! pay attention only to what my subconscious says!" -- I _COULD_ say that, but I won't..... because tbh I have no fucking clue wtf my subconcsious says most of (had: half of) the time. It's all cryptic and symbolic and metaphorical and analogical etc. I sure am glad I'm not trying to hide my homosexual tendencies (yea an egg up yer bum really does enhance masturbation: don't try it and YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING (FAGGOT!)), they'd be leaking all over the place through my subconscience and I'd never even know it.
