i was singing along and i accidentally said "it's getting lonely (or was it cold?) on this timeline" instead of "it's getting cold on this island". pretty sure it was cold. i then realized what i said out loud and my phone heard and said "oh well, what i see on my monitor is way better so suck my dick"
