this is here
this is now

i can refer to now
but never be here again
i am sitting uncomfortably in my uncomfortable office chair
alone
in the dark
staring at a bright white screen (yours truly, mousepad text editor)

idk what i'm even trying to say
but i guess it's something along the liines of that carpe diem shit
don't torture yourself

THIS IS NOW
always
