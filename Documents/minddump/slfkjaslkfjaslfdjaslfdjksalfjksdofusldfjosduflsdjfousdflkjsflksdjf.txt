Continuing from that Caesar shit: even if all life is is the "selecting of which path that has already been taken you wish to take again", I am content with that. Since our minds have reset since then, it will seem a new experience.

At the very least, we do have the capability of choosing (or convincing ourselves that we are choosing hahahahahahaha) which previously taken paths we wish to now take: that is (or at least seems like) free will.

We are blips of infinite choice. Everything has happened before, but everything will (had:can) happen again.


Relish it, enjoy it. Comprehend and accept the potential delusion. Move on.

Shit SEEMS real and I find it more mentally enjoyable to CHOOSE that it is real (with full acknowledgement that I may be completely wrong (and probably am!)). I have free will because I have free will to have free will (even if all 3 are delusional, fuck it).


Feels good man, made progress today.
