Ambiguity is the key to doing and saying anything you want right in public. Right in front of a cop even. This upsets me because explicit'ness is my specialty. Programming is extreme planning. Programming is the art of being explicit.

My mind literally exploded with new thoughts and implications etc of how to use ambiguity to communicate with others. The "double amgiguious" (as in 2 layers) communication with others such as myself. I have to be the puppet master. This only barely makes sense as I write it. In fact I forget the precise details of how to even implement it. But I took it to like 7 levels throughout the night. Wish I had a keyboard handy because it was at a kick back. Bah.


Been sitting on "programming is extreme planning" quote (sans all the rest of this) for quite a few days/weeks now :-P. The ambiguious thoughts all came last night though. Oh and I also filmed Robinson cooking today (timestamp lacking).
