Batshit insane and loving it. If you aren't batshit insane, you aren't treading new ground. If you aren't treading new ground, you aren't exploring the unexplored. If you aren't exploring the unexplored, I would argue that you are wasting your time mimicking your surroundings. ENJOYING COMFORTABLE ARE WE?
