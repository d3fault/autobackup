Life is essentially a crinkled up ball of a single sheet of paper. Analyze it long/hard/close enough and you'll see it's just one giant simple sheet of paper (appears flat if you get too close). Art is effectively the surfing of the crinkles. They are perceived by us as complex (even though they aren't (mathematically)), therefore they are (relative to human perception).

Math takes all the fun out of life and gives you the accurate/simple view.
Art takes all the truth out of life and gives you the wild/complex view.

Both are necessary for life to be "interesting".


Some minds devote themselves to polar extremes. I'm making a conscious effort to hop back and forth and everywhere in between. Variety is the spice of the worm of the life of yea this sentence sucks lewl




I'm a tiny bit displeased with the word "truth" in the "art takes all the..." sentence. Perhaps "accuracy" would be a better substitute... but I used it just before it so that's not good writing LOL (fuck you english teachers (jk wruv u)). There is truth to art... in the same sense that there's truth to our perceived realities. We are squeezed out consciousness.


To say "society shat me out" is the same as saying "society polished me into gold". Really which one you choose only reflects your state of mind (depressed/happy)... but I see them as "mathematically equivalent".


wild/complex/INTERESTING is more like it!
