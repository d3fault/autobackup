Tons of hiccups (only fixing on the live servers so they won't even be reflected in the commits, fuckit), to be expected. I called myself a pussy as I sat shivering staring at my monitor contemplating my next action, then pasted that password and sent the email and made a post on /t/. I felt a weird new kind of fear in every cell of my body (body fear vs mind fear? idfk)... then after a few minutes felt great and relieved. Now I still feel a bit happy to be on the other side, but I'm getting bored doing bugfixes and just eh "waiting" for things to compile and extract and blah. I expected the "button press" to be near-instant, but it's become a multiple hour process xD. And I haven't even started trying to turn on Abc2. I am excited to finally be able to start lots of projects (and to continue work on some I've already started (Osios2/d=i))
