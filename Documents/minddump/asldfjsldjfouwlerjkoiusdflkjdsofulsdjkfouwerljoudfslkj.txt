I choose to think I can choose. Whether it's a delusion or not is, considered, but "chosen" to be ignored. Or perhaps deluded that it's been chosen to be ignored(??? so lost here ???).

I'm trying to think of the opposite (for fun):
I follow a script that makes me know that I'm following a script.

How fucking boring is that. I'd suicide if that were true.

BUT MAYBE IT IS. The script might be lying to us, telling us we have the ability to choose!


Or is it: "I follow a script that doesn't let me know I'm following a script (this sounds more accurate, but less "direct opposite")"?


Fuck it.


Ok just saved but realized, isn't there a 3rd?



I choose to not know that I can choose? what?

I guess that's true too. I don't "know" that I can choose, but I choose to think I can. Meh I may have fubar'd that and it sounds quite dumb and equivalent to the very first thing I said. What's different about it?

Maybe that they are accidentally equal is the starting point for some larger school of thought regarding life as a whole and yada yada. Or maybe I just did the logic wrong. Fuck it.
