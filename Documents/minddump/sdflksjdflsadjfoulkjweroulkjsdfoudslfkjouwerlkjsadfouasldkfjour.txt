I logically (programming) trace the chemical reactions (chemistry) of my feeling music (music). Or at least I attempt to using what little knowledge I have. Fuck me I can't wait to learn chemistry and music. I can only feel music I listen to... but I'm highly anticipating the day I can feel and make feel(music) simultaneously (as well as understand on chemical (why not through a Physics degree in there as well to understand vibrations traveling through "air" (and a medical degree so I can understand better how my ears/brain work)). Understanding is god. Understanding, appreciating, is all there really is.... but it's enough. It's more than enough. There is way more here than can possibly ever be understood. Meme's clash collide and create infinite more in a matter of a few characters thought/said/typed/etc.
