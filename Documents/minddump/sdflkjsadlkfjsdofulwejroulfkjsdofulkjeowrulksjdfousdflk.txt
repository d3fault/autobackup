I can say with relative certainty that the [evil] corporations aren't spying on me. Because if they were, I'd be dead. The illuminati/government/etc may be and if they are: they have my back. They support my goals and want to see me put them in action. I've done enough writing privately on this fucking hard drive. Time to actually do something (which coincidentally will still involve a hard drive... just not privately anymore!!!!). My first Action as a human being. I don't think I count the releasing of all these files as an Action. That's Action #0... a precursor or something. What I do post-launch/release will be my first Action. I'm 24 and have done absolutely nothing. I'm glad I'm going to do something though... most never do a single thing their entire lives. Gotta give myself a little bit of credit (THOUGH I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING _YET_ SO NVM LOLOL).
