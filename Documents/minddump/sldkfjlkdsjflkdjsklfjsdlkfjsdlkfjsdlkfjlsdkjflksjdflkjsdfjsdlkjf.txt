The reason evil exists is because two instances of Steven Curtis "d3fault" Wieler II could not get along in the same room together. I'm a model fucking human, perfect in every way. No emotional hangups or denials etc. EVEN STILL, I need my fucking space. I like an empty room and to let my mind drift. I couldn't get along with an exact copy (mind and everything) of myself, so it's easy to see why there's so much evil in the world when 7+ billion of us are forced to share the same existence (had:earth).
