I think I meant paraphrase instead of plagiarize. Or at least the paraphrasing that is plagiarizing but not copyright infringing. I read up on it and, I feel as though I've said this long ago too: rape the idea from the expression. Steal the idea and add your own faggoty ass expression. THAT is why we will catch up an order of magnitude faster than it took to discover.

Patents, however, are ideas that cannot be used. In fact they don't even need expressions (though their description (the patent application) is one of sorts). You come up with an idea then sit on your fat ass and collect royalty checks. I fucking hate patents.
