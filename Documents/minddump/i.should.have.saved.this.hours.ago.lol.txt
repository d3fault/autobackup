i want to code a appp where i just press ctrl-t to open a new tab. there is also a new tab button but keyboard shortcuts are better considering i want to type into my private machine without my "online" computer even seeing it (different computer) and while watching something on my online computer/playing a game i guess too. boadwalk empire atm but besides the point.
the system saves the date, the title (auto-title is first few words unless changed before save/publish(WHICH?)) and the content
and i guess the content type, which is text in this instance

ctrl-t saves the other one and moves onto the next
but in the context of tangents, you wouldn't necessarily want to close the upper layer, as you might later return to it?
so it saves (to prevent data loss), but it can be appended to before publish to represent a single "node"?
