This visuals of a hacker(movie)-esq insides of a computer, scrolling up/down some huge list of blahWordsIdfk and then finally selecting one, which raises it (lol 'garbage'). Much longer list and much darker environment than in the hackers movie. Combined with the sound of a huge machine with giant gears turning on for the first time, the "oomph" as the ripples in the metal catch up with the rest of the machine. This scene keeps going through my mind and I experience it often while tripping balls. Or maybe it was just once. Or maybe it was never and only in my waking sober thoughts lately.

The start of the universe?
