i move to south korea and broadcast myself doing it. once i'm making 2^10 days (just 10 days, doubling the cost of advertising every day. i should use the "4x 15-second ad segments" idea scaling the audio/video appropriately (scaling audio the RIGHT way. video will be easy lol))
after successfully doing that and maybe eventually being able to be mobile (batteries, chin/helmet/hat/chest/shoulder/something-cam,fingers,air-gap security while still maintaining online connectivity), i call the economy stupid for allowing me to do this
meh
i KINDA am contributing
contributing words and ideas and technology
that is why i make money
10 days of pre-purchase would net me 1024 for that one day, adding up all the prior days i'd be making a lot per day. if it stayed at 10 days i'd be making 1024 a day constantly. that's (does math because cpus are awesome and i suck at them so i don't do them): 373,760 a year. 6 full time 3rd world servants would be like 50k total tops but maybe more idfk. slaves would obviously be cheaper but they are frowned upon. ROFL. i kinda agree with that. but i also feel that paying 3rd world humans pennies to be my 'servant' is just as bad.
