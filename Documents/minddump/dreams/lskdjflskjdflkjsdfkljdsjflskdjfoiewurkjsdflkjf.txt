To be alive is to be a slave to your dreams, and to love it. After all, they're YOUR dreams.

Had a lucid dream last night that I was falling in the sky but realized it was a dream, became lucid, and flew away. The realization that it was a dream quickly faded and the only thing I could really say about the flying at that point was that it was cool/fun/felt-good-man. It was a tiny bit chilly but that's to be expected when flying in the sky.
