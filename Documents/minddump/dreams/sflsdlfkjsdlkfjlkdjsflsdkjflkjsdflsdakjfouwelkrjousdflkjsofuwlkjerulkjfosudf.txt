Dreams:
1) Lost + Mini Dirtbike
2) Jail
3) Jail
4) Inflatable dwarf/thing


1) 2 nights ago dream: Where am I? I woke up in a car and was far away from where I was when I fell asleep. I felt amnesic. I felt ill (logically, not physically). I thought I was being brought, by my father who was also there, to some counselor/shrink/etc. I even mentioned it to him and maybe said something like "I don't think they'd help" (because I was blank). We drove back to where we came from (I don't know the purpose of being away to begin with). It was some indian reservation type apartment complex or something, idfk. The dream changed a lot when we got there and was now centered around a mini dirtbike (pit bike) that a whole bunch of us rode around the dirt parking lot and up and down the road. A whole bunch of us = my family, bechers, and I think even some of their friends (because we are losers hah)... like I remember Arby's friend curtis being there etc. We all made a giant line to ride the bike... there was like 20 of us. Tangent'ish: A military colonel and some other dude were in a jeep and riding around the same dirt lot ish. Fucking hella blurry this part. I had a first person in jeep view, but I don't think I was in it. They went off some hella huge jump in the jeep and starting doing barrel rolls in the air and I think they landed upside down on the roof and fucking died. I feel as though the dirt lot and apartment complex was minitiarized (sp?) as they were in the air: it was like they were in an airplane and not a jeep. Back to the line stuff: I waited patiently for my turn to ride the bike and eventually I cut someone else off who thought it was their turn, saying that I had in fact been waiting longer and it was just that I let so many others go in front of me. I remember feeling scared watching my sister ride the bike because I worried she'd crash and get hurt, but it felt hypocritical to not want her to ride it at all.


2) 1-2 nights ago dream: I was in jail/prison and it was leisure/exercise time out on a field/court. I was alone/new and I tried to just mind my own business and I remember trying to go piss behind a column of sorts, it was behind a corner and holding up a shaded lunch/sitting area. The "guy in charge", who reminded me of a PE coach, blew his whistle or some shit and told me I wasn't allowed to be there. I wasn't able to piss anyways because of the lack of privacy, so whatever. I went over near the "main group" of convicts, who were playing a basketball game, and I just leaned up against the wall next to them mid-court (the column would be "back and to my right" as I leaned against the wall) and watched because what the fuck else was I supposed to do. I think at some point I even started playing basketball, and I knew it would get rough (aka Jungle Ball) and I hoped I could handle it but was pretty sure I could. A snapshot of blur, as in the scene "jumped" to the next, and it was night time and 3-4 (4 total including me? or 4 others? idfk) guys were pulling me away from the court and away from the doors to go back inside. It was obvious they were trying to rape me, and I struggled and ran. They obviosly could catch me, and I even remember the PE coach/guard offering me safety by saying "what's going on over there?", to which I yelled back: "no thanks". I knew that siding with the guards would get me shanked etc. I failed to resist struggling and I remember the black leader of the group (the other two (three?) were idfk what race... but I think there was a white guy in it) saying something like "only every once in a while". Those weren't the exact words but they'll do. Maybe: "on occassion". A snapshot of blur (like the other), and it was now the next morning and I woke up tattered and torn in an equally tattered and torn cardboard dog house (behind a wooden shed). I didn't remember actually being raped, but it was pretty obvious that I was. I wondered (later?) if the dream just skipped it, or if my brain shut off so as to not remember the rape (since it was a dream, there is no answer to this). I was the center of attention now to the "main crowd" that was walking back out on the field and the only thing on my mind now was retaliation. I knew I could kill them if I snuck up on them etc, but I feared retaliation for that from their friends... and I wondered if I first needed to get permission from "whoever was in charge (willem dafoe in that one movie (though not in this dream lol))". I think ultimately I concluded NOT to take retaliation, but I do distincly remember some random guy in the crowd making a comment like "you can see the look in his eyes: he's going to kill someone" -- or something. I think my relatively short sentence was another reason I didn't want to kill someone: slippery slope that keeps you in prison for life.


3) Last night's dream: this jail/prison dream was ridiculously long and elaborate/amusing, so ima start with an outline so I don't forget shit:

-Roxann fight, me defend, me nut stomped, me picked up for "father son" relationship :-/
-Waiting in line going up some hill to Food area (or was it some other amusement park thing?), with Roxann, we take an early left and go off some really high diving board thing. Was more fun for me than her
-Vending machines behind glass get "pushed" / broken from behind and some raging lunatic starts "sliding" trays of food through the glass and bitches that someone should do the dishes or something
-Medical arcade, everything free
-Me considering, and maybe telling Roxann I'm sorry but, I'm going into isolation
-Surfing or kick boarding (way smaller than boogie) out far to MASSIVE fucking waves in sight, two helicopters (one warning me, the other egging me on). Electric wire. Turn back because safest choice.

-Roxann and I were in a large gymnasium that was full of co-ed convicts. Her and some girl got an an argument over something silly, and the girl started kicking the shit out of Roxann. I was like "meh, I could break this up with ease, so I will"... and I grabbed the girl kicking the shit out of Roxann and pulled her back. Didn't hit her or anything. I sort of instantly knew the mistake I made, and I looked to my right and sure enough a guy was charging at me to come kick my ass. I don't know if it was his girlfriend or just friend or what, but the rule was that girls deal with their own affairs and guys deal with theirs. Guys cannot help girls, like I did. They guy charged at me and punched me and knocked me on my ass, then proceeded to stomp my balls. The dream was unrealistic because I got quickly on my feet and sort of defensively (but without words) said: "ok ok I won't interfere anymore" and he went away. I knew I probably should have hit him back, but I didn't because that would just earn me even more of a beating (there is no winning when you're a fucking pussy scrawny little bitch like myself). A few minutes/seconds later, some fucking hulk ish dude came over and picked me up. He had blonde hair and resembled some douchebag actor that is real. Spiked blonde hair, "bro", idfk his name or any movies he's in so fuck it. He picked me up and said something like "we're going to have a nice father son relationship". I struggled a bit and reached my hand over my head to try to grab at him, but before I could do anything he simply said: "if you hurt me I'll cause you more pain than you can imagine"... and before I could grab/hit him in any way, my finger ended up in his mouth and I could feel his tongue and yea it just sort of stayed that way as he carried me off, presumably to get raped. I thought about killing this guy too, and/or going into isolation to escape the rape. OK tangent: cruel and unusual punishment. Our criminals are subject to rape. That's not cruel/unusual? I bet alien species have the same problem, because "butt" is probably a common feature for an evolved species.

-Roxann and I were standing in some line but I forget what for. I saw a shorter route right near us and pursuaded her to come along. It was a big dive. She jumped in regular, but I think I did some kind of fancy dive in for fun. I also distinctly remember as I was entering the water, being able to see the bottom. I was able to decide and/or warp the dream, while at velocity, as to whether or not I hit the bottom. I made the bottom go back and forth, like a sliding potentiometer, determining whether or not I hit the bottom and broke my neck... or didn't and nothing happened.

-Some huge fucking guy raged and broke a window using a food tray. He was on the inside in some cafeteria portion, and me and some others were outside in line waiting to use a group of vending machines. Just behind the vending machines was the dirty plate drop off, and I don't know what the guy was raging about but he just kept grabbing trays and sliding them out through the broken hole and nobody was really able to use the vending machines while he was doing this... and I worried that those in charge would now shut down the vending machines for all of us: the bastard ruined it for the rest of us. I remember a blue turkey sized meat being on one of the trays he slid out. He had gravity on his side since the line we were in was on a hill (maybe the same line as the other one)... the trays all slid down/out. Nobody said anyting to him, we just let him rage.

-I don't think I need any medication, but I visited the inside of an "arcade hospital" and was baffled that all of this was free for convicts (not unlike real life). There was like a pinball machine or various video game arcades, and each one dispensed a different form of medicine. Sure there was a guy behind the ticket counter, but it didn't look like you needed to get his permission/etc to use any of the machines (but idk, I didn't use any).

-At this jail we had access to the ocean/beach. I was on a kickboard (MAYBE a surfboard, idk) and there were REALLY FUCKING HUGE waves out in the distance. I was the only one with enough balls to try to go out there and ride them. They were like 1/2 - 1 mile out, idfk. As I was kicking, a helicopter came up to me and I got the feeling that he was telling me to go back to shore. I don't recall him saying anything at all, but it seemed like something he'd say: he thought I was trying to escape the jail/prison. That helicopter came from "out on the sea, and slightly to the left"... but another helicopter came from the shore directly behind me. That one said on it's megaphone: "ignore the other helicopter, keep going". I put a great deal of thought into whether or not this was sarcasm. I wondered if he wanted to see me get shot by the first helicopter. The second helicopter then made a remark about telephone wires that were scarily 10-20ft in front of me and NOT ALL THAT HIGH ABOVE THE WATER. He said something like "they've been XXXXX", idk what XXXXX was, but it was his way of saying that I wouldn't get electricuted. Still, seeing those wires (and being confused about what he said about them (and not trusting him either way)), which I didn't see until he mentioned, were the nail in the coffin for me and I turned back. Back on shore, I later talked to the 2nd helicopter pilot/guard and found out he was serious about me going forward. He thought it would be cool to see me ride those massive fucking waves.


4) A swimming pool on the front yard of the Bechers, Robinson and I went in after maybe having a smoke or a drink (or both), and I/we pulled out some fucking expand-in-water dwarf or someshit. The word dwarf doesn't seem to fit, but idfk it was like a silly little semi-smart semi-retarded creature (not implying dwarfs are retarded). They were white and meshy once filled with water, and they started out small as fuck until water was applied. We got a fully grown one "out of the water" and it hopped around and did little giggly shit and fuck if I know wtf it was (but I think metaphorically they represent babies). Some girl was the owner of the fully grown one and she took ownership of it came out of the water etc. I took my own one into the water, but only let it soak for a few seconds/minutes before bringing it back out... whereas the fully grown one was in there for hours/minutes/days/weeks(?). Mine did not resemble a dwarf at all. Mine was now a choppy little 2x2 ft "mountainous" area of.... silvery metallic... shit. I knew it needed more time under the water, but I wanted to demonstrate to someone (I think Kaylee, who was standing next to the pool), how awesome these little things were. I remembered a line being spoken/heard from somewhere (where?): "the water has to seap into all the cracks for it to fully inflate". I figured I could just put it back in the pool and let it continue to inflate (no idea whether or not this was correct). Still, mine looked pretty badass after being in there for only a few seconds (before going into water, I would describe as a boring small white [rectangular?] cube): the silvery metallic spikey upward growth (it was still moving a tad even after I brought it out of the water) made for some badass visuals in my dream.
