I had a dream about time travel, but all I can remember about it is that I used some kind of QDateTime object to calculate how many years had gone by. I had to stuff a "started" timer into some header file and had to make sure that nobody touched or moved it until the distant future, where my other time travelling self arrived and used it to see how many years in the future it was (3 comes to mind).

Another dream where some guy was driving around and blah it's kinda blurry but anyways towards the end he like bailed on his [fake?] wife and started walking down some hill to go to a pub or some shit... to occupy the rest of his days. I felt a SWOON of depression as I myself tried to answer that same question (there is so much nothingness), but then I felt a SWOON of happiness and excitement as I realized while waking up from this dream that I'm Steven/d3fault and I know exactly what the fuck I want to do with my life (and it isn't as boring/depressing as sitting in a pub drinking for the rest of my days): launch->code->die
