There was more to this dream than I can remember, but at one point I was sitting on a couch and my grandma tobey came and sat next to me. She was crying, but it seemed more happy than sad (but a mixture between the two). She leaned against me and put her head on my shoulder, said something or other, then said sincerely: "show me some emotion". I replied that I can't just force emotion out, it has to come naturally. I also added that I could fake it like a psychopath if she preferred. Watching this conversation, sitting in a different chair off to my right, was Kaylee (couldn't see her while looking at my grandma, but all I had to do was turn my head). Her presence modified my behaviour/words, just like video cameras modify everyone.


Another dream seemed like I had the ability to stop time. It was a waking dream... I was in that delerious state just after waking up. Not much made sense, but everything that did was perfect and/or metaphorical to some stuff (idfk what anymore). There was something relating to music. I think I could stop time and play music on my computer indefinitely, but that's just a guess. Later I stood up to go take out the trash ("you know it's easy but it seems harder every time you try to think about it" (williamberry)), and sanity flooded back in and I was like "oh, I wasn't stopping time after all"... and worse, whatever that music thing was disappeared from my thoughts and I still can't really remember what it was.
