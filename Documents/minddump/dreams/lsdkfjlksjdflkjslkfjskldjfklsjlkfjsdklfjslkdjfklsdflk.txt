I was in the bathroom looking at myself in the mirror. I pulled at my hair and it detached from the top of my head like velcro. I only lifted off a few inches, was afraid if I took it all the way off I'd never be able to get it back on again. I could detach the top and two sides independently. The hair as it detached stayed together, like a sheet of hair velcro'd onto my head. I took this as a sign of sickness, possibly cancer (I did think in the dream about the fact that it isn't cancer that makes you lose hair, but chemo... but...), and felt death coming my way `relatively` soon. I curled up in a ball on the floor of the bathroom and wept. I thought to myself "I sure as shit hope this is a dream". I stared at my face really closely in the mirror, trying to see if it was a dream or not. I've never stared at myself in a mirror so vividly while dreaming (and have been trying to do so for some time now)... so in retrospect that part was pretty badass. I kissed the mirror (testing your senses can sometimes tell you whether or not you're dreaming)... this kiss felt realistic as fuck (cold hard mirror). I determined I was NOT dreaming. The shitty feeling didn't go away...

Woke up a while later extremely happy it was just a dream ;-).
