had a weird dream last night, a while ago now

was driving my dad's altima on the freeway
hard to drive as usual

and i scraped it twice on the left hand shoulder twice
at speed
on the freeway

and i was trying to convince myself that it was a dream
but i was incapable
as if my subconscious had taken over

i stopped and got out

around this time i guess i went walking and then came back?

with ryan rehnke, his mom and his sister

i saw them walking this way and i hestitated to turn around and they'd simply never see me
instead i just stood there and let them approach
ryan of course recognized me and announced it to his mom

we walked back to my car parked along side the freeway and they talked to me as i worked on it?
or something
idk
but i remember being in the car and looking at ryan's butt (wearing jeans) which was where his ankles should be

the guy's like 6'5 so he looked ridiculous

i then got out of the car on the other side from which they were standing and inspected the damage from the scraping (idk why i didn't do this at first)
it was at first just on the front left portion and was just like a pretty deepish scratch
i think at this point i knew (ryan + his mom were standing on the freeway with me?!?!?) but i don't ever remember actually thinking it... it had to be a dream. but maybe i didn't have it figured out by then. still incapable. idfk

anyways the gash just kept growing and it went up towards the windows when it was more towards the middle of the car (in terms of front to back)
i remember pealing it and liek idk i guess rubbing it out? like i could buff it out with my hand
and it'd momentarily go away but then reappear
