Short/vivid/lucid dream where I was standing right next to my actual bed and my room was dark. Was facing my computer/desk. I was pretty sure it was a dream, but not very confident. I took a few slow steps to my left, towards the door, and then woke up. I somehow deemed running to be dangerous, but I don't know if that's because for some reason I actually considered it dangerous, or if just because I was afraid that running would pull me out of the dream. Woke up laying in bed with my face against the sheets.

My interpretation of it is that IMT is real and that each instance seems so real (because they ARE real (hell, the dream was real too -- and I wasted it)) (and singular) that it makes me afraid of doing anything at all, and I waste all/most of them because of that (taking a few slow steps towards some door instead of jumping screaming dancing with excitement (or <insert-bullshit-here>))
