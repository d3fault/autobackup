I was talking with a girl who was I guess my gf. She said something along the lines of "let's meet up here/at-the-horse-stable every morning". I guess we worked on (trained?) a horse together or something, and this commitment was symbolic and really a commitment to each other. I think after I agreed we may have hugged/kissed, then after a moment I said: "I have a confession to make", and she replied something along the lines of "here it is" or "here it comes" or "oh great *sigh*"... she was anticipating the confession to be negative, especially using her facial expression. I confessed to her that I'd been [secretly] coming to the horse stable every morning for quite some time now. She was surprised to hear it.

The dream drifted off to me replaying how I was 'secretly' there. I'd be behind other horse trainers and such and/or hiding behind planks of wood just out of their sight. I tried to make sure the horse always saw me but that nobody else did. I reasoned that as long as I was there at the races, the horse would be calm (and win)... or something along those lines. Shit maybe i was the jockey even idk the dream didn't elaborate.
