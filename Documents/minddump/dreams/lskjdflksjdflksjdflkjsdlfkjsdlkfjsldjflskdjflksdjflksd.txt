This dream was a few nights back, when I was in the middle of solderland: I was using the fingers impl to control 10 different segments of christmas lights on the front of a house, and then it started raining so I started taking everything down quickly. I don't think they got damaged. As I was taking them down from the roof, they were flowers. Roses. Not sure if red or white, just remember them catching water.
