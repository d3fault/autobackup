Was talking to Jeff in some 3d virtual environment. He was into stocks and him and a group were teaming up to play the game. He simply spouted out stock names and I just switched to them whenever he said one. Happened a few times throughout the dream. The stocks were visual. Each person had their own 3d rectangular prism (maybe 2 cubes long) with their own coloring and maybe their name on it. The stocks would stack up sideways onto the businesses (black dots on the walls, buried beneath the stocks). Each human had a varying amount of stocks, of course. I just followed Jeff mindlessly and understood how/why it would work. It did work, though not "fast" or anything. Just a steady increase in total monies. Later in the dream there was something about nude humans walking around on the floor (funny, I don't remember any humans in the dream before that. but that's not to say they weren't there, I really don't know).
