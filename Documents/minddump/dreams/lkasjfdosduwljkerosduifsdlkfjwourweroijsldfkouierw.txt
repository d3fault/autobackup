oh my god finally i just remembered my dream from last night that i forgot around the time i wrote about the molly one (wanted to write it immediately after but forgot what it was)

lion attack jump repeatedly to get away jumping buys you more time as they are somehow diverted away when you jump
but you can't jump forever gotta find a place to build a new home

there was a tribe that i was being rejected from
and i had a gun handed to me because i had to check to see if the chamber was free but while doing it you see me doing it and get freaked and shoot at me but your gun isn't cocked either or something. you miss maybe. then i cock my gun after being shot at a few times and dodging each then take my one shot and then run away zig-zaggedly off into the lions domain (the middle of nowhere. i almost go off a cliff but i grab onto a rug as i climb back up (only to spot liions off in the distance as i go off the cliff (but am not sure what animal they were. lions was one of my guesses (the two i's in lions indicates that))))


i felt like i knew it was a dream but wanted to see where it went regardless
or perhaps i was simply unable to take control
but i don't remember trying to take control and failing
but that doesn't mean i didn't try and forget the trying
