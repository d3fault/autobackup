A movie that seems like a dream (err, swap that) where there was like a central dark "goth box" and it was sort of like an amusement park type thing, but pretty small like the size of a studio apartment. It was in the middle of some dirt and perhaps there were trailers/campers around it. You go inside it and it's dark and there's like tiny rooms about enough room for one person and you alternate between each of the... 6-10 rooms and each one has a different "thing" (but I can't remember wtf they are precisely aside from the one I'm about to describe). I saw from outside an angle that you couldn't see when inside a goth amusement park worker slid in from a kinda low opening and either blended in perfectly with a black seat/wall or perhaps they used double mirror tricks but yea she would like slide somewhat towards the center of the "room" and do something in the middle, perhaps/probably (leaning towards definitely yes, but can't put into words what it was) something that LOOKED magical or fucked with you etc. I do remember being in the room[s] but I don't remember much about being in it (such as the trick), but later I had an outside perspective (behind as well, not where the entrance was) and saw those shenanigans.
