Had a Nuke dream maybe about a week ago. Was exactly what it sounded like. Someone announced over something that a nuke was coming and we had less than a minute left to live. Everything shrank. Everything became meaningless. All my life and all my work and blah everything just amounted to nothing (note: that will probably never change). It was as if I heard the nuke falling from the sky and only had until it hit the ground to live. It's been a while since I've had an [even fake] NDE, and idk this one was so brief and my life seemed so brief and all of my concerns washed a way and the only thing left was a gut-wrenching "no" as the bomb dropped.

I did definitely think it was real and I recall even thinking momentarily (mind fucking RACING btw) about IMT and that it's ok because I'll live on in another universe. It sounded plausible even then, but is still only just as plausible as it seems now (I often wonder if I'll simply figure out some missing piece of the puzzle during my last moments alive). I don't remember the bomb actually hitting me, the dream either ended or the death was too abrupt. When I woke up I genuinely felt as if it had happened in an alternate universe. As if somehow a collective conscience of all the infinite universes are able to project pictures into one another (as dreams) when something "drastic" is going on (such as an adrenaline rush from a fucking nuke). Plausible, yes... but most likely good old paranoia and jump-to-conclusionism.
