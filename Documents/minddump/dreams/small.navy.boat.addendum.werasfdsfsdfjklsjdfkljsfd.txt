Another part of the small ship part of the dream: It was a lifelong dream and I became the oldest. The old oldest now dead. I looked at the younger members now as I was (then unborn). Idk just time slid back and forth in the dream and it was weird becoming those who were in charge of me when I was younger. Another part of the dream was when I was kinda high up in the ranks and there was some female ranking above me. I don't kno where we got it, but we found a large cylinder of... liquid... drugs (the painkiller kind whose name slips me (morphiene, etc)). The lady in charge trusted me to take them and lock them up. Luke was in the dream at least for this part: he told me to keep them out of his reach because he wouldn't be able to resist lol. Despite not even being into those drugs (true story), I still took a little cup full when I was alone and about to put it in the locked chest thingy. I just like to get high what can I say. I worried that she'd notice because there were identifier lines on it... but I was pretty sure she hadn't marked where it was just yet (we had just found it). Also worried I took too much and would be drowsy and she'd just be able to tell xD.
