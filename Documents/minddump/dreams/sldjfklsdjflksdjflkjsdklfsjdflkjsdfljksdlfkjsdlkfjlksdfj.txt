0) Jeff got a new 600cc bike and wanted me to show him how to pop a wheelie on it. I told him he needed to pop the clutch. I showed him as well, but made the bike flip over on it's back (it lifted easier than my old bike used to). He laughed and sort of said he'd dropped the bike many times. He didn't seem to care. I picked the bike up and we rode off.


1) Our house cleaner called me out into the living/family room. She told me how she was pregnant and wasn't sure she wanted to marry/be-with the dad. It was hard for us to communicate since she was speaking spanish and I english, but we still managed. I told her to do whatever her heart desired, but I kept thinking she'd interpret that as a joke (since I use it as a joke often). She kept hinting at me and I got the feeling she wanted mah dih. I grabbed/touched her butt and made it look like an accident/falling. She stepped towards me rather than away from me, then we kissed (felt lips in dream), I palmed her firm-as-fuck ass, and we fucked standing there.
