Night before last, was in a remote area that was somewhat woody. Parts were open/desert, but then there was a tree line and woods and a path going into said woods. I hired some guy (who was unseen the entire dream) to fix my computer, and for some reason he left it out there in the woods on that path for me to pick up. I remember suzy's mom being in the dream, but can't remember when/where/why. I do remember it being a long walk carrying those computer parts (monitor/kb/tower/etc) and I think I was going to have to make multiple trips (and I of course prioritized the tower). Maybe a truck picked me up on the dirt road and I got out of there faster.
