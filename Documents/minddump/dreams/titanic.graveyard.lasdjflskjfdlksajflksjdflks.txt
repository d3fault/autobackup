A titanic graveyard. An island near/right-next-to titanic's crash point (was tempted to write "sinking place", but...). The crashed titanic was docked at some nearby pier, albeit rekt etc. We stood on a hill that was a graveyard overlooking that bay/pier. Families wandered around looking at tombstones, presumably their relatives. I felt out of place and wanted to leave: I didn't know anyone buried there. A car drove up the asphalt road along the side of the graveyard up toward where the hill leveled out and where there was a driveway and probably a building for wakes. I started to follow that car thinking they might know the way out. Somehow I already knew going down the hill was not an exit. I didn't get very far up the hill following that car before the dream ended.
