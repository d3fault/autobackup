Dreams:
1) alien planet
2) fat black bitch
3) nun convenience store


1) This is the most blurry of the bunch. Something about a lifeform stranded on a planet and somehow possibly becoming immobilized and waiting on and/or anticipating a rescuer. No idea if they ever come. Meh that's about it but I know there was way more to it.


2) I was running around the inside of some building, possibly a church (but unsure because of nun in (3)), and some fucking round (like spherical n shit) and oversized black girl was chasing me throughout it. I found a hiding spot but can't remember how to describe it.


3) I went in a convenience store run by a nun and was interested in beer brauts (shit they still sound good I should go buy some :-P). Something about it closing and us walking down a hallway to something else, and before we go in the door to something else I realize "Oh shit I didn't get my second beer braut" (already had my first earlier in the dream but bleh blurry) and we walk all the way back and I get it and eat it. It was fried in beer.
