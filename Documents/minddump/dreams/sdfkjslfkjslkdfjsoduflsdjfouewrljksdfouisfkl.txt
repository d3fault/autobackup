Dreams:
1) Mom cry/laugh
2) Diving board
3) 


There was a handful (10?) of them but as of writing I can only remember two (will add more to outline as I think of them), they were short and rapid and I remembered most of them while laying in bed after waking up.


1) I was kneeling on a gaming rocking chair that I had/have (caydon's now) and was alternating between sobbing and laughing hysterically. I'd put my head/face on the left side of the back-rest and start sobbing thinking about my mom dying, then I'd put my head/face on the right side of the chair and start laughing hysterically about the thought of freezing her. I worried that I was actually sobbing/laughing and that my parents would here me and come in my room and wake me up (I guess I sort of knew it was a dream).


2) I was talking to an old family friend (nameless) in riverside and I was at his house and we were swimming and I jumped off the diving board n stuff. I think I was going to ask him a favor, but that part of the dream never happened. I walked over to the high dive and as I started climbing up a skinny ladder I became lucid. I looked around for a moment and then accidentally woke myself up. The screen/dream became "black" and I tried to will myself back into the [lucid] dream. I just imagined myself climbing that ladder and eh it kind of worked, except the screen was still black. I got to the top and knew where the edge of the ladder was and it took some courage to jump off with the screen still black, but I did. I could "feel" my environment (the ladder, the ground while standing up there), but couldn't see shit. I jumped off and even got a falling sensation, and felt the water etc in the pool. When I popped my head out of the water, I could see again and was in the dream again! That re-entrance only lasted like 1-2 seconds, but I definitely remember seeing color. Progress imo.
