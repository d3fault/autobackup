Oh yea dream last night way before the blue one, went to my grandparent's house (except completely different house i've never seen before) and my grandma and grandpa were idfk like chillin and shit i think we were there to pick them up to go to some amusement park. I tried to sneakily use some kind of white powder (i forget what kind, but maybe baby powder or some kind of shaving thing?) on my armpits because i didn't put deodorant on lol, and then i looked at my grandpa's head and he had the same powder on his head/hair.

Later my parents and i were driving to the amusement park (disneyland maybe, but i forget), grandparents weren't there anymore idk... and as we're driving i realize i don't have my compy in my pocket and start freaking out because i left it at home. i come to my senses because there's still stale copies at other places so my initial thought of 'all my work could be gone when i get home' was not entirely true (just everything recent (all of abc2, for example xD)). eventually i woke up and was relieved it was just a dream :-P
