I was renting an expensiveish condo/apt/etc and didn't have rent. Only had $50 (which is roughly how much I really have atm) and it only covered electricity barely. I was confused on how I got into that situation: I could semi remember that I'm homeless/rent-free but couldn't make complete sense out of it. I think I was using the room just for storage or something. I woke up relieved to not have rent :-P. While in there, there was a jumping turtle that managed to jump over a tarp wall and it only jumped straight up so how it got over is unknown to me. Anywya it kept jumping straight up next to the tarp so I assumed it wanted back over, so I tilted the tarp so it caught him and he rolled back onto this side. I think he then rested in his shell (pulled arms/legs/head in out of sight).
