0) Kim Wexler was walking around on some non-ground-floor of a building with security "stations" that I think doubled as elevators. She fell in a shaft and landed in some water. She survived the fall unscathed, but since there was nothing to grab onto (and/or she couldn't get out), she drowned simply from becoming tired/etc (a terrible way to go). The order of events in the dream don't make much sense, because later she was talking to Bob Odenkirk on an upper floor and they were watching her die on a video and she kept emphasizing "this/that is how I _DIE_" and Bob is well you know hearing her but not hearing her. I haven't watched last week's ep and obviously not tonights, but I suspect she TOOK THE FALL for his airing a commercial without permission, especially considering her oh so convenient explaination about her repuation is on the line (television has to bring something for both the idiots and the not).


1) Some like laundry/dry-cleaner shop and a guy/owner aksed me to watch over it for a night while he (???). Well even thouh there was a phone in there I still walked across the street to use the phone and when I turned back to the shop Frank A and Holly W were running off with the equipment. I felt bad yea the guy's shit just got jacked but idfk blurry somehow the room next door was also a dry cleaner guy and the two owners were friends I guess and he helped me get set back up even though jacked. He put a dry cleaner right in front of the main front door and told me it was gonna get ~120 degrees F in there but then I'm leik "lolk bai" and told him he had it covered etc etc and peaced the fuck out. I don't think the owner of the place even gave a shit about the theft since it was insured anywyas. I think he told me that his shit got jacked twice the previous week (but this might have been awake fillershiz)
