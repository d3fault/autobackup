0) I was sitting in the waiting room for at a doctor's office and a picture on a magazine table across the room moved (the contents of the picture moved). Something else moved too, I forget what. I stood up, walked over, and said "I just hallucinated". It didn't fit, because I don't usually hallucinate, so I determined it was a dream. But instead of becoming lucid, I just woke up. I think there was a male doctor standing next to me/the-picture when I said I hallucinated, and it might have been House xD.


1) I was getting fucked from behind by a [male] cousin that I have no attraction to (he does not resemble a female), and simultaneously, with each thrust, successfully gagging on a dildo or something mounted on the wall in front of me. There was no pleasure or pain on either end, but I could feel the friction. It was weird  (being him) but I just didn't move. He started speaking and then I burst into laughter and stopped the whole ordeal. There was coffee and I think white caffeine chemicals (which I've started drinking (flavored) since it's easier than making a fire fore coffee) all over the floor, idk why.


2) Was playing with Caydon on some ship and I walked out of a cabin while talking to him to go do a dive off the plank (for fun). He tried to stop me at the cabin door to talk to me about something, but I explained that I could listen to him while walking over to the plank. He got a little mad that I didn't do it his way.
