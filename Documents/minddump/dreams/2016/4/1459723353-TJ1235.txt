These happened over the past week or so. I went to parents' house for easter (family in town), which got me out of my groove (dreams + code). There were way more dreams, but I forgot them :(.


0) I was an employee at a hotel and I was walking in the courtyard with a bunch of our towers basically surrounding me. A tornado started spinning in the courtyard, and I got very excited by this and ran directly into it to try to get sucked up into the air (I guess I was hoping it wouldn't be too high to result in death. was hoping for a moon jump). It sucked me way up into the sky (but not higher than our towers) and I was pretty sure I was going to die from the fall. My infinite probability drive kicked in though and saved the day. I landed on the balcony of some guests who were doing drugs (the dream didn't mention which kind). They were amazed at what they just witnessed, and offered me some drugs. I declined. The hotel security was able to watch the tonardo and saw where I landed, and they sent a security guard up to that room. I think I was on the way out as he got there.


1) Called Roxy and sat on the phone with her for a few whole minutes of silence, then I eventually said "I'm hanging up now" and did. The dream other than that was I think about sunken ships possibly with treasure in them. I think the danger of them collapsing upon entering (BUBBLES!) was pondered
