A dream where I was on a beach with I want to say Molly and her friend Lauren and we were lounging on in beach chairs and something happened and or something was thrown, perhaps just sand (blurry), and like it err eh uhm served as bait or somehow fucking got a snake to show up and it was one of the red on black ones (i can never remember which is worse, and the other makes an appearance soon ;-P) but eh one of my guy friends whose face I don't remember was like now on the snake holding it maybe cooking it idfk and I was like "whoa that's all you have to do to get a snake?"... so then I guess I did it too but only after walking a bit down the beach towards a pier. While standing there for a while at the top of the beach hill (formed by waves) I got bored and did a bunch of side flips down it and yea it was pretty fun and seemed real at the time (OT: before going to bed last night I requested and err.. (definitely didn't "demand")... told myself I wanted to have cool lucid vivid long lasting dreams etc, and yea I'd say it kinda worked but without the lucidity :-/. I bounced around the subject of "I am in control" vs... "nope not really my subconscience controls my dreams"... and of course "but my subconscience is me so wft?". Yea idk I just like repeated over and over "I would like to have a lucid dream" in my thoughts as I drifted off to sleep... but as I already said, I wasn't demanding it (because leik wat if my leik subconscience will be all leik "hurr you don't make demands to me" and then not geef me ne gewd dreams ya know LOL?)). So uhh yea after the side flips I think I did get a yellow-black snake and yea it was kinda scary to handle but I did eat it eventually, shit tasted good and had a nice zing to it :). There was another part of the dream right around here that might have had to do with a building (school?) but it is forgotten mostly..
