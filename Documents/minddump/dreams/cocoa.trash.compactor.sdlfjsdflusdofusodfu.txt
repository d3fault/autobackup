Another dream just came back to me: Cocao was bugging me just like he always does when I'm trying to code. There was a universal trash compactor and I had the option of being able to put him in it (to kill him), since he annoyed me. It was like a government (except the government seemed universal) provided death machine. I guess I opted to doing it at first, or maybe I was just considering idfk. Either way, the more I thought about it (or maybe the close I got to doing it), it made me sick to my fucking stomach. I've never felt worse about death in general. Surely Cocao didn't deserve to die just for rubbing my legs n shit when I'm trying to code. Found out not much later that there was another option to freeze him instead, but that option cost money (like $20, but the amount is arbitrary really). That option sounded better but I still didn't want to do anything at all to Cocao since all he was doing was bugging me a bit. I remember waking up and drifting back into this dream over and over (but within a short period of time)
