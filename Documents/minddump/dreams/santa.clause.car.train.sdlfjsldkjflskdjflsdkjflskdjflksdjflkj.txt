This dream happened I think the night after I tripped balls this past week. Santa was driving a car and I was in passenger seat. He was driving sporatically and it was scary. The dream lasted a decent length, but a lot of it is forgotten. I only remember a few bits and pieces. A [blonde] girl (my age) was in the path of the car going full speed. She shrieked a shriek; you know she feared for her life. I don't think we hit her, but maybe we did (I have no recollection one way or the other). My guess is we swerved. I think I was telling him to stop and shit over and over but he wouldn't. Eventually I scream STOOOOOOOOP and grab the shift lever and throw it into park: fuck the transmission. We come to a stop right in front of train tracks. A huge speeding (hella fast) train passes right in front of us (it would have hit us). The entire car ride there's some fucking shitty santa clause christmas song playing ("sugar coated reality"). I tried to look up which one it was, maybe "here comes santa clause" or "santa clause is coming to town", but maybe something else similar.

I tell ya the dream sums up my feelings almost perfectly right now. The "hack the system, even if you have to hurt it a little" analogy of throwing the shift lever into park... the SHEER TERROR of _NOT_ doing it (I still have no idea HOW to do it ffffffff)!!!

edit: after thinking about it for a few days, I'm pretty sure it was the song "here comes santa clause". The mention of a "lane" fits (but I didn't notice that at the time (my subconscious is SMART yo)), and so does the obnoxiousness of the main chorus.
