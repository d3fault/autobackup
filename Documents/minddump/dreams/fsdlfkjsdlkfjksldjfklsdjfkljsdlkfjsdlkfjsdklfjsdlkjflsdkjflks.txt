Had a dream where I was in a jail/prison and there was a room with glass windows for two walls, and another room that went along the border of it and extended further in both directions (the outside one was much bigger). A bunch of us inmates were in the smaller room for a period of time, I'm not sure why... perhaps eating food. Afterwards, we were in the outer room/hallway looking into the smaller room through the glass as one other inmate had his turn in there. He was a giant, which is I guess why he was kept separate from the others. During intake, we were asked on a form whether or not we had a problem with people over 6-something feet tall. You had to know in advance (it was "common knowledge" in the dream) that you should select yes (you did have a problem with them), even if the truth was that you didn't. If you were to indicate on the form that you had no problem with tall people, you would have been thrown into the same room as that giant guy (more or less isolated (from the majority) along with him). We all stared at the giant through the glass as if he was a monster.

Another part of the same dream, I was running outdoors away from an inmate chasing me and trying to rape me. I became lucid (or at least 'pretty sure' I was dreaming), then decided to stop running since it was just a dream and didn't matter. When he began to rape me, I expected to feel pain, but felt nothing instead.
