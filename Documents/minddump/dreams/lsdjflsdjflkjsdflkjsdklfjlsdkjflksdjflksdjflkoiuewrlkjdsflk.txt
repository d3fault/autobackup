0) Pinball
1) Disneyland bazooka shorts


0) Night before last: Was playing some old as fuck pinball machine that spat out some kind of candy (perhaps gumballs) as reward. The thing looked dated. It had a 3rd bumper that was hidden by some piece of the machine: if you leaned forward over the glass you could see it, but standing normal it was blocked by some 'wall' of the game board. The right bumper sneakily redirected to the middle/hidden bumper. Sure there were 3 levers and you could play all 3 bumpers, but that required knowing that the 3 levers/bumpers were there (I forget how the 3rd lever looked).


1) Last night: Was at a place that resembled disneyland and my dad shot a bazooka of some kind (might have been heat seeking) straight up into the air, but it went sideways more or less right after coming out of the launcher instead of going straight up. It landed in two places, and people scrambled to put the fires that started where the pieces landed. The fire that landed closer to us was pretty small, but still there was a worry of it spreading since it was in a wheat(?brown grass whatever) field. The other fire was a bit larger and I think attached to a shack. I think the other fire was also across a lake/river of some sort... kind of reminded me of that huck finn island crap at dland. Someone ran up to the small fire in the field and threw my green shorts over it to put the fire out. They didn't get damaged much from the fire, but I was still iffy on whether or not I was ok with the fact that they used my shorts. I think I was mostly ok with it. I could smell the stench that really did(does, but I'm not wearing themanymore) exist with the shorts yesterday -- I had been wearing them for a few days. Smelled like a nice mixture of BO and shit (both IRL and in the dream).
