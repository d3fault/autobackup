I forgot to mention that those black finger gloves were shown to me by my cousin Heidi's little brother (who doesn't even exist haha). We were chillin or something in some random house there was a lot more to that dream before the fingers part but all of it slips me). I also asked the little brother: "how much do these cost?" and he said $100/each and I thought it was reasonable :-P. I also remember Heidi being up on some bunk bed (top bunk) and her brother and I over on the floor nearby just chillin/standing.

Another thing I forgot was for the "room" dream: the girl the made the room and that was in the room was brunette. I kept thinking that if a movie was made out of it they'd probably pick some stupid looking blonde dipshit and fuck it all up. I also thought "meh it's implied because anybody that knows me knows I like brunettes". Yet here I am writing it anyways :-D. Brunettes kick ass. She (the one _IN_ the room) might have also had some sort of like hippy bandana thing on. Err not bandana.. but band. Head band? idfk. Hippy shit. She was fucking hot that's all I know... and not like "uber dressed up with a FANCY outfit hot"... so get that shit right mothafuckas.
