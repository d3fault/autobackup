A dream last night where I was shot in the head from under my chin. I fought off the shooter at first, but he already had shot my torso etc so it was a losing battle. Moments before he pulled the trigger for the bullet going into my brain, I stopped fighting and just accepted it and relaxed. I had my hand/finger on the tip of the barrel trying to pry the gun away at first, but then started carressing the gun. This confused his friends (and possibly him, but I had my eyes closed so could only hear his friends) who were standing by watching. As soon as the bullet entered my brain, I began tripping balls.

What I consider unrelated: I _also_ (?) lived (variant universe? idfk) and then some guy said something like "now you know what it's like. they can explain it to you, and you must study/memorize it". My subconscience seems to be telling me to go in a different direction. I could still launch in silence and sew my mouth shut and not release any decryption keys (music + code (no comments (or, comments stripped before release)) only)... but obviously I don't want to (and probably won't).

Death is spooky, but not fearing it makes you powerful.
