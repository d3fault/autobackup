I had another dream that's just coming back to me. I asked someone (I forget who, may have been Jeff or just some asian in general) if "aboutToQuit" is asynchronous or synchronous. I've always been under the impression it's synchronous, but am now starting to wonder because certain "have stopped XXX" messages aren't showing up etc (yet, valgrind doesn't bitch). If not, guh where the fuck is the blocking mechanism in Qt? Fuck it for now I'm not even doing Qt coding atm (balls deep in Wt/boost/couchbase and about to blow my load (been saving that line but eh here's a good a spot as any)).
