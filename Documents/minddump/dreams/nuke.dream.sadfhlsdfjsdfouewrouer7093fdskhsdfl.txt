Had another nuke dream, this time I was in our suburban with I think my mom and sister, driving pretty much directly away from the point of impact. I saw the nuke fall from the sky and it was fucking massive. Like one of those giant mario bombs that slowlyl travel through the air, this one was similarly shaped (MUCH larger, though from the distance we were at in the car (many miles) it 'seemed' about the same size as those mario ones (me being mario)) and this one was orange/white instead of black with a smiley face. It dropped kind of unrealistically slow at a 45 degree angle into the ground. I started freaking out saying we're witnessing the end of the world etc etc, we're about to die. Told my mom to step on the gas, etc. I saw the blast wave come towards us out the rear window and saw it shrinking as it got nearer and nearer. Just before it got to our car I said/realized "oh, looks like we're going to live through this" and we did as the blast wave was just a foot high of dust as it passed our car. We stopped after that and I started flipping out some more saying I must be dreaming etc. I tried so hard to determine whether or not it was a dream, but even my usual tactics didn't work. Had my mom/sister pinch me, then for some reason wanted to get out of the car and idk like hug the ground or something (anything to mess with my senses). Before I could get out of the car the dream ended and I was just laying in bed.
