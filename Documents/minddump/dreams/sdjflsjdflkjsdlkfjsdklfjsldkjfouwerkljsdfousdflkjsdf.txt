Dream where I was sky diving and parachute opened and I ran along the ground (grass maybe?) really fast, impossibly (or improbably) fast. I took ridiculously large strides. It was this unrealism that made me confident it was a lucid dream, so I ran with it (HAHA PUN SEE WHAT I DID THERE). I ran somewhere I forget where, but along the way I hopped into a ditch and then smelled a flower on the side of the ditch (the "wall" if you will). I even thought of the expression "stop and smell the flowers". I think the flower had a smell, but I can't remember what it was. It was a yellow and white flower. A little bug, perhaps a gnat, flew around my face as I was smelling it.
