had a dream last night that i was snowboarding down a grass mountain and was like going off jumps that were like the streets of sf (flat, downhill, flat, repeat)
and my elementary school classmates were like travelling upwards
perhaps on a bunny slope pulling chairlift? but i saw none.

i high fived a few of them

only two i specifically remember high fiving were ryan rehnke and georgia anagnos

i also remember seeing katelyn erik a bit lower than those two (there were lots others btw)
and just noting that i was jumping hella far and going hella fast[er] than her

(note just now realizing: that doesn't make sense, as she was travelling upwards also. it was god-knowledge that i was better than her at it)
(she just happens to be the only one out of that group that i know snowboards [well?])
