Was at a carnival or parade or fair. There maybe was a semi-riot going on, maybe not. We were on some streets doing something at the very least. Cops came up behind me and told me to freeze/put-my-hands-up etc. I'm not sure if they were there for everyone or just me. I raise my hands slowly because I'm scared af they're gonna cap me. A muscle in my right arm (bicep maybe) spazzes out and I lose control of it momentarily (a few seconds at most). My arm drops back down towards my hip/torso. A cop screams "GUN!" and shoots. The screen fades to black/red, I got shot in the back of the head.

I thought about it for a while afterwards: They probably got it on video, and could probably eventually (years, decades) figure out that it was an arm spazm.
