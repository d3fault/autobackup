0) Ski sniper rifle night, I was walking along the streets of gilbert/mesa, either with my mom or dad (I think dad), and some crazy looking mid-40s bitch said something along the lines of "wan2fuck?" (ok that's how I'd say it, she said it in her own words). I said "let's meet up later when I'm not with my dad", and then we agreed on a time and place. I think it was gilbert/university, but maybe F-something/university. At 8pm I think. I'm not sure I went, might have bailed on her.


1) A blur of a dream from last night where I was out in the country away from a city just chillen (perhaps camping), and I found out about a hit put on me. I even got to meet and talk to the person hired to do the deed; he may have been who tipped me off.
