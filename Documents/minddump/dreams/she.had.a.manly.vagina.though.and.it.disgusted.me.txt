A girl and I hanging out and I think I tell her I like trannies, so I think she may have brought a friend around 'for me'. Seemed like a party environment/house, maybe a townhouse, and/but we were upstairs away from the party, just us 3. The tranny had a cute/fem face and looked mostly passable (only those of us who study trannies obsessively could tell the difference ;-P). [S]he had a manly vagina though and it disgusted me. I guess it was a post-op tran (eww), the vagina looked bulgy and protruded from her pelvis more than most do. Idk how I saw it so early on, maybe there was a hole in her pants right there or maybe she just got nekkid pretty fast. I don't remember what exactly I said, but I pretty much rejected her [sex] with some line that I can't remember at all. It was like "I don't like XXX", but what did I fill in the XXX with? I don't like men? No idea. I tried to let her down softly and she didn't seem too offended. Later after she had gone/walked-away I changed my mind and decided to go for a HJ (mb a BJ). Tried to backtrack and find her but she was gone. Kept thinking about her pretty face.
