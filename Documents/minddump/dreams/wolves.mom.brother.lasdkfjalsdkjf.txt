had two dreams with wolves in them
one where i was walking along a path and heard my mother's voice screaming for me as wolves were taking her away. she was off to the left, out of sight
a wolf started running towards me, and i at it... but more towards a hatchet. i made a growl and he only ran passed me instead of attacking. i grabbed the hatchet and felt safe. the part of the dream ended right there, with me charging after my mom into the woods. i, even while dreaming, couldn't comprehend how she'd still be a live. wolves don't drag their shit off while it's still alive. they kill it and eat it there.


another part was my brother got eaten by a pack of wolves
i found their "den" and there was a big trail of blood and guts. i mean like A LOT of guts and it made a trail of blood and guts that was pretty thick (way more than a human amount) leading up towards a hill (and even slightly up the hill) towards their den.

i went in the den (armed i think) for revenge and all of the wolves ran out to save themselves. i remember regular sized wolves as well as child/baby wolves running out to save themselves. it was a weird dream and i didn't kill any of them. i think they all just left and there wasn't much to the dream
