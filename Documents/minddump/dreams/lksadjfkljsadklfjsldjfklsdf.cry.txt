Bawled in a dream and it felt so relieving, moreso than any other cry. Since it felt real in the dream, and indeed I even woke up feeling positive side effects from it, I consider it to have actually happened. Crying is a completely mental thing (the tears do nothing), so crying in a dream counts just as much. I was on the floor in a restaurant (fast food or in between) in between two booths where a table would normally be. Some lady I think a worker there walked toward me after a bit of crying (maybe starting her shift), I didn't make eye contact with her and she just let me be, and I tried not to care about the embarrassment. The beginning of the cry was depressing but letting it out felt good. I was thinking about how TIME just keeps passing me by and I have nothing to show for it. We're on a conveyer belt towards death, all my loved ones are slowly dying and I'm wasting it.
