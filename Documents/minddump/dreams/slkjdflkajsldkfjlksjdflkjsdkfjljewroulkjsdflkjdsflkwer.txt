Oxygen was an extremely potent drug. The dream started off or I guess was a thought as I was drifting off to sleep: thinking about oxygen in your veigns and how you die from it. I wondered if liquid oxygen (there is such a thing, right?) would still kill you. That's about where the dream took over and yea some form of oxygen was a drug that made you trip balls. I was in some room in a hotel or something but I think the room had crashed to the bottom floor and me and some others started wandering around a city and idfk it's all pretty blurry but the theme was oxygen drugs n shit. Toward the end of the dream we ended up back in that same hotel room thing and had accidentally done an entire circle. It was difficult to trigger the high or to dose or whatever. I think we really just sat around and did nothing and sometimes you'd start tripping balls and sometimes not.

Another, seemingly disconnected, part of the dream: 2nd cuz by adoption Tanner and I were at some arcade playing some really long game. I think because we weren't losing that we had unlimited play time. We eventually got bored and wandered away. Could still see the [big] screen of that game and eventually a 10->0 countdown for player inactivity began. We contemplated running back but since we were bored of it anyways we just let it run out. His was the first count down, but since I stopped playing a few seconds after him mine was next (they were back to back (queued), not side to side). I considered "harder" I guess running back for my own one, but still didn't. We walked around the arcade some more and maybe played some other game that was a bit harder. Either or both games may have had to do with shooting, I forget which. I feel like the big screen one was soccer related maybe. This whole arcade scene may have taken place when wandering away from the hotel room in the first paragraph, unsure.
