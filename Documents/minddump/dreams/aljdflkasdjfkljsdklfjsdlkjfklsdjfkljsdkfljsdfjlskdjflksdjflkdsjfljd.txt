0) Bike
1) Coffee cruise


0) Barely remember any of this dream. One of those small racing bmx bikes, except it had a motor on it. The motor wasn't very powerful and may have been electric. I do remember twisting the handle and it going forward, but I didn't go very far. Was fun (and I'd buy one). We left it somewhere (it wasn't mine), walked somewhere, and then the bike dropped out of a ceiling and landed right in front of us.


1) Was on a cruise with uncle greg and tried to pour myself some coffee. An employee stopped me and insisted I order one instead (and it would be charged). I didn't have an "unlimited drinks pass" (greg did). When the coffee came, just to be a dick (payback) I told the waiter "we" didn't want it anymore (was sitting next to greg). It wasn't the same waiter as the one that stopped me from pouring my own. He didn't say anything and took the coffee away (customer is always right). I decided that just food at the buffet was enough (probably with water). I saw a big mound of red jello and planned on loading up on it for my first dish. I also saw bacon, but it was at a table I wasn't standing in line for so I planned on getting that later. I sat down in the back of a large room. Greg and some other guy (his friend? idfk) sat more towards the front/center. He called for me to come up there, but I didn't go because I'd rather not be front/center like that. I sat down in between two ladies and said some kind of polite greeting, I forget what. Something like "good morning" but more formal. The lady on my left said she was a teacher in either africa or india and she started going on about her job and the lady to my right and I just listened and asked the periodic question to keep her going. She seemed like a nice lady who was treating herself for once.
