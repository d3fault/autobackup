Dream: Tobias Funke was talking with some miltary/politician/government official and had funds "assigned" to him or something. Perhaps a payment, perhaps an inheritence, I don't have any clue. He then went to some priest to "cash out". Attia [of the Juluii (sp?)] was standing behind him as he did this, and she warned him that it was a terrible idea.. because doing so means the government/whatever could sieze the money: "the government outranks you". Right around the same time, as his gold coins were being laid out on the table in between him and the preist, a few women back even further than Attia (more in the "main room", whereas the table and 3 of them were in a sort of separate room (but there was no door/wall in between)) saw the gold coins and got all giddy eye'd. They started bum rushing him and you know, just being typical human females (whores). Tobias got all defensive and realized that what Attia had just stated a few moments earlier was true to a greater extent than just the government. He tried to block the vision of the coins on the table with his body -- simultaneously trying to keep them out of arm's length... but it was futile. Err, at least the vision blocking part was. The dream ended right around here, but I don't think the women or government/soldier/etc ever took his money [yet].

You can just imagine Tobias (the actor's name slips my mind (but he kicks ass (SUP))) getting all bright eye'd as he plays the ignorant/fool realizing the error of his ways.


Right around when it ended, I knew it was a dream and I had a firm understanding of bitcoin and it's existence. I knew such abilities could finally be blocked. I guess you could say I woke up and was glad to be living in the age of bitcoin.
