nazis

Had a blurry as fuck dream where we were on some sort of beach thing and there were different.. 10-20 man groups scattered around the beach. I think there was a pyramid that I/my-team climbed and I remember there being lots of killing but I can't recall exactly how it took place. I think we climbed a 3/4 there pyramid and in the 1/4 missing at the base/center of the pyramid was another (enemy???) nazi platoon (we were all nazis I guess, though I didn't really consider myself one (that much? idfk. hard to remember)). They were on the ground and had a desk and radio shit going on. We were going to drop a nade on them but I think I declared that we stop. I came to a eureka moment and realized that if we all just stop throwing grenades at each other that we'd all be able to live in peace.... or something. Again blurry as fuck and I might be filling in more details while writing this awake. Tbh it sounds like free market capitalism and war etc. Pretty easy to decipher.
