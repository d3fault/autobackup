had a weird dream last night
was visiting / hanging out with matt hardke at the beach
we were in some weird giant cave thing with steps going up to an upper level / street thing
matt was showing off and like climbing around on steel beams towards the top of the cave thing (right around the stairs area)
he at one point attempted to jump for a beam that was a few feet away and slightly lower than the beam he was already on
he jumped intending to land on his chest and grapple onto it
he jumped too far and went right over it

there was a 200ft drop (at least) and i heard him scream all the way down and watch him land on his face/chest on the start of the stairs at the bottom
i was convinced he was dead. no way he could have survived the fall

in a moment of panic (mind you, this dream seemed very real), i called 911
i do recall a brief moment of consideration: should i call 911?

they got their and healed him and he was fine. wtf?

then they tried to say that i had to pay $1500 for the ambulance

i'm like wtf? "thought he was dead!"


idk the rest is blurry but i do remember his mom being there but not in the cave

in an upstairs 'rich people room' dining / socializing with her beach friends and stuff

matt and i went in there at one point, to say hi or fuck i don't know why. dunno if this was before or after he got 'hurt' either
