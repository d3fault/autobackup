Dreams:
1) Zombie
2) Jazz

1) Outdoors house in hilly forest-ish neighborhood cops came onto property through driveway and we were.... idfk chillen. Dream became zombie-esq and the house on said lot was now an apartment thing. We'd go ultra slow through the hallways of this 2-3 story building and there were little random games relating to zombies. I only really remember one "if we all don't step on the red together at the same time, a zombie comes" or some shit. The zombie would pop up right underneath one of us (4-ish) and whoever it came up under was most likely fucked. We'd all shoot it as it did but since it came up RIGHT UNDER one of us, the reaction time required was near impossibru. I remember feeling shit whenever I'd die... but whenever someone else did I'm like "well it had to be one of us". At the end of each level someone still alive could go back to the front of the apartment (where the game began) and like pull you up to the 2nd floor (even though there were boxes here to help you climb). Different games, different parts, idfk all pretty damn blurry.


2) Some jazz shit me and my parents drove to and we parked next to some car that was not scratched. Inside was some black guy singing jazz or something maybe guitar idfk. Was pretty legit. The next day (or just later, idfk) we do the same thing and this time the same car is pretty badly scratched on one side of it. Light blue sedan or coupe idfk. This time it's known ahead of time there'll be more and they'll be doing the jazz a bit differently. Can't put my finger on the word but it had something to do with improvisation (whereas perhaps the day before was rehearsed shit), idfk. There's the same guy as the day before but also now 3-4 others. There's a girl singer and she impresses me with her singing. It was awesome though I don't really remember it (now).
