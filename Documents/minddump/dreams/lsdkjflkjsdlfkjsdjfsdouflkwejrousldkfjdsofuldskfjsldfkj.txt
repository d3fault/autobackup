Took place at 2nd cousin Tanner's cali house, a little bit inside the house but the described scene was outside in their driveway/coldesack. Someone was to be executed, and Tanner's dad Art was to do the execution. The person being killed knelt and even held his own sword up to his neck to give Art something to line up with (kind of like how a barber uses a comb to brace their scissors against). He desired to be decapitated, since it was fast. I don't know if Art missed or was just being a dick, but he instead sliced off a small portion of the top-right (or top-left idfk) of the guy's head. It was a big enough piece to be fatal, but not big enough to be quick/near-instant (like decapitation). Maybe a 5 inch diagnol (wtf forgot how to spell this word all of the sudden) slice. As he and the slice fell, he tried grabbing for the slice, presumably to try to reposition it back onto his head. He fell though and lay their yelling "I'm going to kill you" over and over. He was pissed it wasn't a quick death I suppose, or maybe it was just instincts talking as he neared death.
