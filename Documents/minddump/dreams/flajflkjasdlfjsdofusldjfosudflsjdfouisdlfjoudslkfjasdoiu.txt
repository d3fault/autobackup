Had a dream where I was being evicted or someshit by some fucking people in some ????? castle maybe but idk lol. I was staying/living in an (???????????) which was behind a tree line not far from a grass field which was near the ???? castle itself. I wasn't necessarily being evicted, but there was a deadline of sorts. A group of bored expediting men came into analyze my ... process ... and discoverd instead what I had done/created/something. They got, or for some reason one just came, an intelligent ish English teacher type (I'm thinking Schlessinger?) to analyze it because they were befuddled (I know this word doesn't fit but I put it here just to troll Schless). I can't describe the object itself, but some object was growing spikely through and onto (afixed) a horizontally wide and flat-ish plant and/or vine. My object's grippers were black and viney, but much smaller (pencil width) and wrapped around the plant and even pierced through it.

There was another part of the dream, or maybe a different dream later idfk, where I/we had to do some cowboy type shit and we rounded up wild fucking bulls and cows and shit and yea it was pretty dangerous. I think all of that took place at the back of a department store O_o.


My interpretation of the object with black grippers is my logical analysis of the world as a whole. I've thrown logic at it left and right and haven't been afraid to contradict myself even within the same sentence. There is nonsense in my writing, but I've attacked the problem ("WHAT IS THIS?") from every angle and if you can sift through the clear errors of my earlier writing (which I want to keep as a psychoanalytical data point), it surely has enough grip on/through the world/question to .... ????? ..... count for something (to... help others understand? idfk).
