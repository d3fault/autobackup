maybe about a week ago: had a lucid dream where I started flying around from a neighborhood kind of area, then thought of 'her' and flew into the house I was standing in front of, where she was, and kissed her. I intended to go on flying after the kiss, but the kiss was practically the end of the dream. I'm not sure if she pushed me off (too long a kiss I guess) or if the lucid dream simply melted away as we kissed. either way, I didn't continue flying around and the dream ended around there.
