Barely remember any of this dream. Arby said something along the lines of "hey man let's learn the bass" (bass flute thing. as I'm writing this: does that even exist?) (I guess together). I replied, "hey I have a bass [flute] mode on my [fingers rig]". I think stk really does have a bass flute instrument :-D. Reality is modifying my dreams (there's nothing new about that in general, but HOW it's modifying them is new to me and I fucking love it).
