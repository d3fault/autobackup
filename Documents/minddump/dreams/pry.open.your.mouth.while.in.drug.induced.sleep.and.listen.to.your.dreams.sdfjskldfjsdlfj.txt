Weird dream that I thought was a movie when I was having it. Even just now when recalling it (took me a while), I had to think long and hard as to whether or not I watched a movie last night. I and some friends were propped up in stand up chairs and our heads were tilted back (facing straight up) and held in place like that by machinery. Our mouths were being held open likewise by like metal type shit. I've seen this kind of thing in bondage pr0n, but in the dream our mouths were open much wider. Ridiculously wide + cartoony. We were all asleep because we were all being drugged. The camera zoomed into either my or my friends' mouths, perhaps both. When the camera got close enough, you could hear them speak their dreams (even with their/our mouths wide open, their/our throats could still form words). I don't know if I ever zoomed up to my own throat to hear what I had to say or if it was only my friends, but I definitely thought about what I WOULD say(/hear(?), I was the camera as well) if it did. It made me nervous sort of, like I'd be revealing secrets n such.

This is bleh weird all in all dream and like eh that kind of thing is pretty much already fucking possible. Steal a hobo or someone nobody would miss and you can drug them for a month etc. I'm not exactly paranoid of it happening right now... at least not directly in the sleeping manner (passive cell phone monitoring is much more likely)... but the very fact that it can happen pretty much makes me want to launch all the more. Fuck secrets and fuck those that would steal them and use them for evil purposes. It does seem like a weird dream though still, because I do plan on TRYING TO sleep talk etc while launch. It almost seems like a warning from my subconscience... but fuck it/him, what could I possibly say that, when completely public, could be used against me?
