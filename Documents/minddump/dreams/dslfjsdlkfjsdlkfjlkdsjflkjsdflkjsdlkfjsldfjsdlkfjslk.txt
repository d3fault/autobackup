Teacher martini already graduated
Dream where I was back in hs even though I had already graduated (not allowed irl). For some reason I had to take some class again but idfk what class that was. The teacher was cute as fuck and I think I hit on her as usual. She warned me, and then followed through, with giving me a mostly empty martini glass. I drank the tiny bit that was left, glad to get her saliva in my mouth. Another girl did it and at that point I stated to anyone in ear shot that I didn't want to get all the remainders etc. I didn't drink the leftovers of that second one. There were 20 alc beverages, 15 were martinis and 5 beers. I found that ratio odd. Later we were on a beach and all of us put $100 bills into stacks and did some game or something with them and I knew it wouldn't end well. My bill went missing at the end as predicted and I mildly frantically searched (how?) the people around me. Frank was there and when I saw him I immediately thought it was him and put my hand around his neck, similar to that dream with my mom. In both dreams I could feel their neck in the palm of my hand.

Err going back a bit: something about me ditching the class and just generally not giving a fuck. Teacher would be mid-sentences and I'd just up and leave. Maybe that was why she gave me her remains of the martini...
