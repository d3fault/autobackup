Took place near shamel park. I lived in a house in a nearby neighborhood, and went out either walking or bike riding through neighborhood streets. I think I had a[n acoustic] guitar and thought about how I could make a whole life out of walking around, chillen, talking with people, and playing the guitar. While at shamel park, I sat at a picnic table with two others, I think a girl/guy and I am pretty sure a couple. I think there was baseball being played nearby. The couple and I talked some, idk about what. Casual talk. I think the guy of the couple had found a dog wandering and decided to keep it. Towards the end of the dream I suggested he at least make sure it isn't claimed. A baseball player who was also a dog wandered up to our picnic table, maybe fetching a stray ball. The dog stood upright just like us humans so. I've seen dogs doing this before IRL, but in the dream the dog had much better posture than when dogs really do it. Completely upright and walking just like a human. The dog did go down on all four momentarily, perhaps to pick up the ball. But he stood back up and walked away. I think the dog had a baseball cap on. I told the guy he should train his dog to be able to stand like that too.
