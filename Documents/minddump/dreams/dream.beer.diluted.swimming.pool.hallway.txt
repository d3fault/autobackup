dream beer diluted

something about like a large swimming pool area with diving boards and a hallway swimming pool where folks were doing laps and lifeguards were present

we (someone else and i) pissed off the diving board area people and like we left and then came back the next day but then sat in a truck, didn't get out, then went and swam in hallway pool

we didn't get out of the truck so i said "us showing our faces here [at the diving board area pool] does us harm since we didn't get out of the truck (makes us look like cowards"... but the other guy disagreed because he is less intelligent. he thought it showed we were willing to still be there or something


so anyways we went swimming in the hallway pool thing and had miller high life's with us that were already opened but we had to hide them from the lifeguard so we both put them in our swimming shorts and swam on our stomachs freestyle and i was picturing the water going in the beer bottle and diluting the beer and a lot of it coming out. i remember thinking i should hold my breath, go under the water, and try to chug that shit before it got too diluted. i also remember feeling like i had already done that, or something similar, before





the beer getting diluted and being already opened made me think of nobodyme and how i opened my brain but then am now trying to suppress it... but there are possibly others out there (lifeguards) that are now looking for it specifically

have no idea what the diving board shit was about
