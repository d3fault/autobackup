"I make millions a year in advertising revenue and I don't lift a finger"

Watched Newsies yesterday/earlier-today-before-sleeping for the first time ever and my dreams were filled with that kind of big media type shit and I think Robert Duvall was even in the dream :-P.... BUT it's all mostly a blur and the only thing I remember was toward the end "some other big media guy" (WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ME?!!?!?) said that above quote.

I'm going to amass power but unlike my opponents, I'll be lobbying to have my own power removed (robotic automated society) -- at the same time as everyone else we all surrunder our power (that'll be the day (but HAVING and being willing to surrender the power, will certainly help the argument (nobody gives a shit about you if you have none))). I think/hope/predict that "the people" will get behind me and support/embrace/etc MY products over my opponents for that very reason. Oh durr hurr Ima here to save-a dah w0rldz (bleh).
