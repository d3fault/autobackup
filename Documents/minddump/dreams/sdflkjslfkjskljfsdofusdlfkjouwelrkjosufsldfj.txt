Dreams:
1) Arby and I were buying weed from Curtis, except it was through a middle man or something. We went into the middle of a big grassy field, maybe a football field, and some black guy runs out there to us full sprint and he and Arby go into some random shed in the middle of this field and negotiate the weed (ended up being $280 :-P). The guy brought 3 full bags of weed (1oz each), and Arby bought one of them. I wondered why the guy sprinted, but figured it was because he was trying to be an efficient businessman. He ran away just like he ran to us. Later Arby and I were driving and some (3?) cars which we thought were cops were following/chasing us. The guy that sold us weed was in one of them and when they eventually managed to pull us over, one of the drivers simply asked for directions, which was weird. Either a fork in the dream or erroneous, idk, I/we thought Curtis had set us up. Maybe that was a different part and he really did set us up, idk.

2) I don't remember much at all of this one but it was pretty realistic. Gerard and I were flying our own F-22s and we both landed to take a piss break. Since I landed first I was away from my plane longer and some guy (the owner of the planes) ended up letting someone else fly my plane. Gerard was fast enough pissing that he got to go fly his some more. I didn't feel too pissed about it or anything, I was still grateful that the guy let us fly the planes to begin with. I was thinking "man, not many people get to fly F-22s in their entire lifetime". There was an office building nearby and we did some stuff on an upper floor of it during/throughout the dream (before flying? so blurry).
