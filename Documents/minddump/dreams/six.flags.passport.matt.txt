six flags passport

had a dream where i was on a bus from out of state to an amusement park (six flags or something) and i was with some childhood friends. matt hardke and his friend kyle were there, but there were lots others on the bus too

i remember getting dropped off or something and either getting on another bus or this dream doesn't make sense i don't fucking know
i remember we needed out passport to get into the amusement park and that i had forgot mine on the bus in my backpack

i remember asking matt if i could use his phone (since mine was in my backpack) to call his dad, who was driving the bus, to ask him if he could grab my backpack (which i'd argue is light... but if he didn't want to... my passport alone would be good enough).... and that matt's friend kyle (whose last name slips my mind) was using the phone first. i asked what he was using the phone for and he replied that it was to call his father who was still in another state to have him bring his passport. i made the argument that matt's dad should be parking the bus any moment now and i'd miss him if i didn't call soon, whereas his dad's not going to be here from out of state anytime soon anyways so it didn't make much of a difference. he complied and i guess i called
this was a weird fucking dream that went on a lot longer than this (lot of ON-BUS scenes that i completely forget)
