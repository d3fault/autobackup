In a room with no floor, on the top bunk of a bunk bed, sky diving back down to earth. Someone (girl?) asked me to configure something, but when I opened the config panel, it was numbers instead of a color widget. The number pad could have been used to select colors, but only if you had them memorized. I realized that while I had configured a similar panel to use a color widget (perhaps on a different bunk bed), that particular one was still using a number pad.

Much later, and across the room with no floor, I think maybe I was dead or just out of the picture. A bunch of humans were scrambling around in there. A guy sat in a chair that was against a wall. From where the people were congregating, you could only see his hand/wrist/arm resting on the armrest: the rest of his body was hidden behind yet another wall that came out of the... wall. He set up a dummy hand/wrist/arm that looked identical to his own, and then climbed into a hatch that was just above that chair (also hidden by the protruding wall). Up there he met up with another guy. I think they were both scientists but maybe businessmen or politicians. It was a secret area that nobody else knew about. They strapped themselves into something and then activated something (self destruct?) that blew up that entire upper area (somehow they were unscathed. maybe they left during countdown). The upper area was pretty big, maybe a couple miles squared, maybe less (hidden how? idfk). Their reason for blowing it up was that "it couldn't be marketed to".
