Hilly foresty area with a train going around. The dream was long and I rode the train a few times and hiked around and stuff too, but most of that stuff is forgotten. One part I remember though, was standing in between 2 train stations that made a U to connect to each other (the bottom part of the U was at the top of a hill). Standing there I just got a huge burst of energy and/or adrenaline rush and I started jumping up and down really high and doing rapid punches.... not to train for fighting but to train for parkour. It was genuinely fun, I could jump higher than I can IRL (couldn't figure out why in the dream). Considered doing some backflips too (I've been backflipping a lot IRL lately... off of objects roughly ~3ft high and into grass/sand/soft areas -- also been doing hand stands and hand stand pushups <3), but the fear of death made me not attempt any.
