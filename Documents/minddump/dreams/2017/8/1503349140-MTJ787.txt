A fokken t-rex chasin us through our house. Chased my dad down the cali house's hallway where the rest of the fam was (incl Caydon) and we all scattered. I was pretty sure Caydon wouldn't be able to escape, but helping him would have cost me my own life.

There was a part of it, but it seemed kinda separate, where Caydon and his neighbor friend were playing outside and since I knew the t-rex was coming I went out and grabbed them. While carrying Caydon's friend, I bumped his head on the door a little bit while bringing him inside. He wasn't hurt bad, but it was enough to make him cry.
