Saw a mountain lion. Was walking along a mountain road. It came down and around some bushes on the side of a hill leading up to the road. He saw me and I saw hiim. He feared me and I feared him. We both kept away from each other. I mean he vanished into the brush pretty quickly but it's not like he was in a fight-or-flight mode of escape. He just left because he wanted nothing to do with me. Nor I him.
