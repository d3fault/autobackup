this one was a week or so ago: SHE finally admitted her feelings for me, and we kissed some. was pleasant. but then she started acting funky, doing "inappropriate" (by modern society's standards) things. I realized she had cracked, and the pleasantry became the opposite. relieved as fuck when I woke up to find out it was a dream, even though IRL she doesn't have (or won't admit to, who knows) feelings for me.


My surfboard got a gash in it and was hollow on the inside. I expected to see like foam or something. The gash was pretty big, but I didn't give a fuck, I'd patch it with jailbait weld in a little while.


was showing my solar cooker to uncle gary and suggested he put a cup of water in there along with mine, for coffee of course :). something about a foil lid (which if you don't use, bunches of water evaporate).
