night before last: Dicran and I arrived at his house (he was driving) and he just got the new Halo game (there was no number attached in the dream, because I have no clue what number they're even at... fuck halo (except halo 1), might as well be halo 7 for all I know). I wanted to play it a tiny bit but there was only 1 controller. I stated "I don't even know where the last halo left off", then walked away. idk where my destination was, maybe my parents' house, but doesn't matter I just walked away from nick and his [parents'] house.

last night: Caydon was playing halo 1 blood gulch (woot gj caydon in my dream) and he was actually decent at sniping, but I had to tell him to always be strafing, which he quickly picked up on and the strafing even helped get a kill just a few moments later. some time later he was attacking the enemy base (they had stolen his flag and were headed back to their base). he was jumping down off the cliff ledge on the side'ish and I pointed out to him that there were 2 people behind him to the left. rather than turn around and blast those fools with his rocket launcher, he ran away lol. I told him not to do that since it was just a vidya gayme. I think he got into a melee battle in the enemy's base right around where the flag is, I think he had the flag during that time and I wanted to explain to him that he'd be better off dropping the flag and shooting a rocket, but eh there maybe wasn't enough time for that so idk if I did or not, it's blurry.
