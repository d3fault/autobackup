Night before last (same night as the cop killing me dream), had a dream I was in a factory I owned and the ad revenue finally started rolling in. It was almost instantaneous, I went from 0 BTC to something like 40 and then 60 BTC in a matter of seconds/minutes. I thought the value of BTC was still up at $1k USD, so it felt pretty cool.. but in the dream I realized that that figure was off. Still it was nice. I even noticed and felt "bleh" about the fact that I felt so good about finally having money. It meant I could continue this dream. I felt bleh about it because it made me realize how much money affects our lives. It is practically the primary governing factor, despite my trying oh so hard to not let it be (goal: BTC/day >= costof(3x hamburgers/day) + server expenses). There was a physical conveyer belt where the ads were coming in, except I think they were hanging from a line rather than sitting on a table. Like human-sized paintings or whatever (various sizes, but about 5ft on average). That physical representation is pretty realistic given the queue/time-slot nature of Abc itself.

More people started to crowd around me now that money started coming in. Just like out of fucking nowhere (I anticipate this will be true xD). I also felt I needed to up the security of the system (rather, the "factory" in the dream) a bunch. I think there was an upstairs part of the factory and maybe that's where some/the money was (idfk). OT: I need to push all my data to freenet (delete proof -- and hey I might even be able to serve ads to freenet I'm unsure), and I am considering implementing PKI hackily/wonkily into Abc2 (withdrawal requests must be signed by key provided at sign up (which I need to download/save, and not allow to be changed)).
