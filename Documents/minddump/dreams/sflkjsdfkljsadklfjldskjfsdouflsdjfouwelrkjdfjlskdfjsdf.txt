dreams: white space ship, missouri river

Had a dream that seemed pretty real where I saw a white space ship rock back and forth in the sky and I somehow knew it was friendly (and possibly (probably?) even alien). Another dream that same night where one of those plastic kid house things that sometimes have a slide sank in the missouri river because it got too much water in it's roof and then toppled. Irvin was there and he was enthusiastic about swimming down to retrieve the various objects such as "flashlights" that sank with it.
