0) Halo sidewinder, brandon roll hill, bad penmanship (2000)
1) Halo teeworlds throat mic
2) Fight "A lot of people would have knocked me out", "I suck at fighting"
3) I did have a lucid dream last night but can't remember much about it. Maybe a scene where I'm looking at the glassy water of a lake.


0) Night before last I think: Playing halo sidewinder yet still semi-school setting (the game was the school). There was a hill and I think brandon rolled down it violently (for fun, like we used to do). It looked too steep for me. A teacher told me I had bad penmanship and showed me an assignment I turned in (just before going to sleep I watched Mel Brooks' 2000 year old man cartoon)


1) Same night as (0): Was playing a 3d halo teeworlds thing, idk what it was, some hybrid of them. Was talking on xbl with some tw regular (a pro -- maybe maple or dinner), he said brb and then while he was away I switched the headset out for my throat mic I just got. He started talking before I plugged it in so I didn't have much time to position it and the audio was pretty shit.


2) Talking about science class with science teacher next to a pool, 2 kids from jr. high but I think 1 grade above me (joel and some other nameless?) tugged my arm/shoulder and said "let's fight". I agreed and we fought 2v1. I let them hit me a few times (blocking only, but they still landed some to my face) and I could feel my adrenaline rushing and the warm tense points of contact. I fought them back some. I think the fight was for fun, but it was never really established (in any case, I was having fun with it). They didn't seem too angry or anything (otherwise 2v1 they coulda easily rocked me). After a little bit of fighting (10 seconds tops, but they were a pretty intense 10 seconds), we more or less stopped and joel(?) I think said "A lot of people would have knocked me out" (maybe with "by now" at the end). I said in all honesty "well I suck at fighting" and that was that.
