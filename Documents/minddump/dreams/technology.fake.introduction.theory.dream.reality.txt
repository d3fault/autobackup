semi-dream thing last night
partially awake

i've thought of this before
but it became real in the dream

there was a group of us and we were responsible for something
fuck the details are so blurry

ehh

basically

the "TECHNOLOGY PRESENTATION BRAINWASH" theory

that i can't prove the technology (for cracking everything) doesn't already exist and that we're presented a "life" where technology is "introduced" (even though it's old) and we accept it because we are just born


i do not believe it because i understand the math behind it. a raspberrypi COULD have a wifi IC built in... but not for that cost (unless fbi etc pays for it rofl)

i'm PRETTY SURE this is the first time technology has.. err.. been invented?

but in the future... computers will be sooo ridiculously small
that it'd be possible

fucking human privacy is a joke
it will cease to exist
i will/am accept(ing) that

i don't remember what that group and i were up to
but it involved technology and murder

like we uncovered a murder or something i really have no idea...
