I was on a mountain road going pretty fast in a car and the steering was difficult. I was in the right lane and doing ok and I remember moving over to the left one lane and checking my blind spot was a bitch but I still managed. The turns were nuts and maybe it was the speed I was going (I don't remember anything specific, even if it was just the speed limit it still seemed fast). My right wheels would cross over into the right lane during the turns to the left some and I then deemed myself unfit for driving [right then and there]. I even maybe recall doing a spin out 180 or maybe that was what I was just afraid of doing. It seemed like an immediate transition where I am now parked on a dirt pull out on the right side and I'm looking over the beautiful cliff down into the green ravine in between the mountains... and I thought about how I could have driven off the cliff and died and stuff.
