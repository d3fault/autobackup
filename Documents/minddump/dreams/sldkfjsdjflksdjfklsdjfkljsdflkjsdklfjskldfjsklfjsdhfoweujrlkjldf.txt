0) I was looking at 9 different era video game controllers laid out on my bed. They were my music. Also they were the 90s style controllers (no analog stick stuff we have today), just buttons and a just a normal rectangular shape. It's hard to explain what I mean by "they were my music" (as in, idfk). They were my music and THEN I realized "oh, they are all videogame controllers". Basically saying that "all the music I'm listening to right now is from video games" (which, while not true, is probably closer to true than it is for most). There was also a part where I was IN one of the videogames (mb controllers themselves?) and there was a boss/monster/character who kept.... animating... (attacking? dancing? idfk). I was in a tiny room with him and I had to get him to stop (I didn't do it by force, but by calling some software function or something... idfk).


1) Walked out of my room in my boxers and my sister's friend was sitting in the hallway. Milf status all the way, I think it was Ashley (married, mormon :-/) but idfk. Anyways she kind of catches me offguard and I let out a "d-Aaah!", which scares her too and she shriek a high pitched shriek. The scream turned into a kind of laughter for both of us a moment after it happened. I sort of fall to the floor as we both scream, tumble into the bathroom (she is sitting right next to it), close the door while basically on the ground, then get up and reflect. I look at myself in the mirror and even do a fake "d-Aaah", and wonder if she could hear me from the other room. I look at my face and it's distorted as fuck. I feel drunk and am convinced that that's thre reason. My face looked squished and my mouth was really high on my face. I was also TRYING to make weird faces at myself, heh. It looked like that pic of Dr. House with is face ultra squishy and scrunched (called "HouseStretch.jpg" on ED. b36aa64ef280bd480311f2f4d8624cb).
