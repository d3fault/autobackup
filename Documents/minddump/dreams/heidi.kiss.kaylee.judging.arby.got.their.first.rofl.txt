had another dream during the same sleep span as the matt 200ft fall

we were at like some kind of family function i don't know what it was
and my 2nd cousin heidi was there and somehow we ended up kissing

it was a fun dream.

semi-'wet', but hardly -- just kissing

we kissed in front of our family and i tried to get her to come into my room so we could kiss some more + cuddle, but she wasn't down
she thought / probably thought i wanted to have sex with her. i probably would have, but my original intentions were just to kiss + cuddle

kaylee and robinson were there

i remember robinson saying that he and heidi kissed once... when they were 5. rofl.

she like called him on the phone (makes no sense since he was there?) and asked him when it was...
...and i spoon fed / guessed '5' and happened to be right? or she lied and just said 5 idfk


kaylee was judgemental and nothing more
don't think she said a single thing
but her eyes said enough

i don't remember if there was any more to this dream but i do remember waking up thinking about my beautiful cousin heidi and having a boner and humping my pillow repeatedly
i also logged into facebook to look at pictures of her :-P



some 'awake' thoughts directly after:
'kaylee, if i end up with heidi will you not tell her that i tried to get with you first?'

that, along with (but also separate from (i had the thought multiple times)): 'you are just geographically convenient' (i don't actually consider this to be true. see below)

more thoughts:
'i don't know either of my cousins. i just know that they're both beautiful and i get along with them' (i was addressing a crowd or a group of people when i said this)

the 'i get along with them' part was made up just now... the original thought was something else, but along the same lines

they are both beautiful. i don't think i'm going to ask out heidi anytime soon.
