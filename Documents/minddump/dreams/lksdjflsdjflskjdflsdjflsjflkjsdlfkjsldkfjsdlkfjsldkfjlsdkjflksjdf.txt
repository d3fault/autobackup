Somethink like I was doing a small stint in jail/prison. Something between a few months and 5 years. They had us all in a room and idk what else was going on (perhaps loudspeaker talking/music/movie? perhaps additional movie?) but there was a TV that made no noise in front of all of us and it flashed a bunch of blue dots and I saw a brainwash image that they had embedded flash for about 1 whole frame. I figured since I was just in that I still posessed the mental capability of detecting it. I closed my eyes and loudly advised everyone else to do the same thing. I figured I'd get in trouble for loudly talking like that, and I'm not sure whether or not I was proven wrong. Anyways, eventually I stood up, walked to the front, and pressed a button to turn that TV off. I did get in trouble for that. The exact word they used was "torture" (ed: how is turning off a TV torture? beats me, but it's my subconscience speaking, so don't interrupt), which I found ironic since it's what they were doing to us. I think my term got extended but idk what the punishment was really. Later I ended up punching (or otherwise hitting) some warden/guard lady (who was old and bitchy). I may have hit her multiple times, and I don't think it was very hard. She then extended my sentenced even longer right then and there (no trial/etc). I think she (typo:thse) added on time for every hit. She went from like whatever I was at years, to 9 years, to 15 years, and then jumped all the way to life in prison. In one sentence my life was over. Shitty feeling, especially given the offense I was in for (can't remember, but I know it was something mild). Maybe those 9/15 were months instead, idk. She just went up ridiculously exponentially though.
