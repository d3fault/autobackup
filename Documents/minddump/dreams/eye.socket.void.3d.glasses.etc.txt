eye socket

i had a dream segment, which i think also belonged to the wolf segment, where my eye socket was removed. i was playing with a metal stick or something or other and it fell into my eye
i pulled it out and my eye came out like a fucking kebab and yea i like stabbed my eye or smashed it
later in the dream i remember thinking "maybe i'll get it replaced one day (science is improving rapidly) but then remembering that if there was a chance of that, i blew it by smashing my eye"
there was like a void inside my face
like the guy on boardwalk empire except only around my eye
like a triangular void
it was like a cave
it went inward
i remember feeling about inside with my fingers
there was ANOTHER eye that was permanently closed shut inside the cave against the back wall
the cave was more... cavey... as in, less.... drippy
drippy is a shit word
i mean like it was a cup more than a funnel
you could put something in it
i can't think of the word but i'm thinking concave/convex MIGHT factor in



anyways i remember thinking i should put some plastic or something over it so dust etc doesn't get in
weird lol



i remember, IN MY DREAM, trying on 3d glasses and only seeing half of the color: only the blue side
i remember feeling shit about that. it was the biggest downside
however during the dream i really couldn't notice a difference
i felt glad to be alive and glad that i could still see... you know

in retrostpect: it was probably becaues my brain does not know what it's like to not have depth perception. the generated images (dreams) were still probably in 3d-mode. you know?


still, i THOUGHT that i'd probably be less good at fighting because i now don't have depth perception

there wasn't much more to this dream
