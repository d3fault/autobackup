had a dream just last night where i was on an aircraft carrier and had the opportunity to fly a fighter jet
there was a nuclear warhead on it, but the nuclear warhead was ALSO a magnum handgun (cowboy style)

i mostly just flew around the fighter jet, it was the main part of the dream / reason for being there

there was someone else with me, we took turns flying the jet. i think it was garrison but am unsure


there was also an annoying kid that did not fly the jet
he was nameless, just small and annoying

i shot him in the head with the magnum
we all knew it was a nuke

the nuke did not go off
the bullet did not penetrate
he was just like "OWWW THAT FUCKING HURT"
like as if i threw a rock at his forehead

it was still a nuke, we all knew it

i don't know why i shot him
i don't know why i was willing to obliterate all 3 of us, the aircraft carrier, and the fighter jet
he was being annoying sure
but idk there was like other [forgotten] interactions between us
i remember something about landing the jet being difficult or something
or perhaps it was taking off

i do remember other parts of dealing with the gun. i remember trying to aim straight down and shoot at the carrier and the bullet just slid out and landed on the ground. each time it landed on the ground we all worried it would go off. i also remember concluding that if i went NEXT TO (like repelled down the side of) the ship that i could aim at it horizontally and the bullet would not fall out. i didn't try it, just thought about it




OH GOD I JUST REMEMBERED ANOTHER [part of / extension of / later on] DREAM

shelica carlson and i got together
she was a whore. this was her profession
we went driving 'looking for a spot'
she said she knew one, we drive quite far
we ended up at some mexican's house
it was a group of people
they (mainly, HE, the 'leader') intimidated me
i think shelica led me there on purpose
i ran out and they made a gunshot (noise????) and i fell and my legs became useless
i think it was just a noise and they did it to scare me
i then ditched my parent's car and ran to the back of their house
there was nothing but desert/hills out there
i somehow knew that they wouldn't follow me that way (whereas if i got in the car, they would have???)

i could not walk, my legs were stiff and perfectly straight and held together like 2 sticks
i crawled with my arms like a cripple, my legs dragging behind me
i did not alternate left and right with my arms (freestyle), but instead did them two at a time (butterfly)
i was shot, or thought i was shot, or whatever [idfk], in the SPINE. is why my legs were disabled
i was fear stricken i concluded
whether shot or not i could not move my legs


before running out, i remember talking casually / begging (except specifically NOT, as that looks weak): leave me alone please
i remember like saying i kindly or whatever
idfk
was weird
i might have only walked out slowly, i forget
i knew i at least wanted to
idfk
weird fucking dream
it ended right around when i was out in the desert behind their house

shelica looked pretty fine though and i wish it was just sex dream :-P
