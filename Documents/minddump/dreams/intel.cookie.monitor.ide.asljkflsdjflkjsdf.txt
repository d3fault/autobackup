intel dream

had a dream with my friend nick in it where i worked at intel
i was in a different department than him
he was deep in the core and i was just a lesser peon

somehow there was snow in between he and i or at least somewhere in the dream and i remember making a line like a foot wide and like 50 feet long from some point to another (me to him? idfk). idk what this has to do with the rest of the dream

my monitor was a cookie and i ate some of it throughout the dream by pealing downwards strips of it. at the beginning of the dream it was a widescreen monitor and at the end of the screen it was a 4:3 monitor, rofl. it was a sugar cookie and i could taste it in the dream <3

i was talking to nick and following him through a hallway into 'the deep' (i made up that term just for writing btw) and was contemplating whether i should continue following him because i'd be more likely to get noticed that i didn't belong and perhaps even fired. i reasoned that if i stayed where i belonged i could blend in better etc. he was working on more sensitive projects i guess. idfk.

so after i turned around at some point and came back to my desk (at which point i ate the second slice of cookie (only ever remember eating it twice), this time the right side), i sat in my chair and like opened up an IDE (it wasn't any one in particular) so that it would look like i was busy if some people at a desk over to my right (like a greeting desk if you know what i mean, idfk) looked over at me.
