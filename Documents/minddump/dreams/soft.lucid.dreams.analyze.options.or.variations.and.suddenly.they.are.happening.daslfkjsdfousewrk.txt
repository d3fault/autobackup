I recall various points throughout the night where I'd be having a dream and then I'd just be reflecting upon the dream in a sort of "black screen" mode, and then I could progress the dream forward from there. I almost call it lucid, but it seemed somewhat accidental. I'd be thinking of something as an "option" and then that something would start happening (my imagination in the "black screen" mode became a dream itself). I even called it out as I was doing it, but I wasn't able to analyze it as thoroughly as I am now. It was weird because I kind of felt as if I was ruining the dreams. "These dreams are already over and have endings" -> "ok now I am changing + adding onto the endings completely" -> does that mean the 'subconscience-message' would be altered or lost? Unfortunately I can't recall any of the specific dreams (or their alternate/additional endings).

Maybe I'm just getting better at lucid dreaming on demand and this is the way it's supposed to happen? These dreams seem much less vivid than my regular lucid dreams. Perhaps that's because they're happening more frequently and "on-demand" than most of my previous lucid dreams (which happen by dumb luck)? I recall it happening multiple times just this last night, but I kind of think it's been happening for a while now (and I just hadn't noticed ENOUGH to write about it).

I hope writing about it now will make me understand/more-aware-of it when it happens again so that I will be able to go fully lucid. It definitely makes sense that they are in fact lucid dreams... they are just more accidental than your typical fully-aware lucid dream.
