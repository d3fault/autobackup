had a weird dream last night/today, just woke up 8:23pm

i was a godlike observer (but not all-knowing)

good guys were chasing bad guys for quite a while, but this part of the dream (WHY?) is fuzzy

eventually they found a lead and the entire sqaud decided to move in on it because it was the only one
a rat became the target of the investigation and was tortured

we/they (?) threw water balloons at him for sport
or maybe they were tennis balls

i remember people standing right next to him laughing having a good time and holding him in place to be pelted

we got nothing out of him, except his original rat'ing

(after the dream is over it still doesnt' make sense why they pelt him)


so anyways we decide "aww fuck it" and just send in iron man
or some guy i don't know who

this part of the dream took place in first person mode, i was the overpowered shit (or i at least saw from his perspective)

the area where we were pelting him was right around a train

the train was like "docked" and it was under the rats care

that was what he rat'd

the bad guys were inside the train


i actually just now do vaguely remember a peon being able to open the train up a little and him being stabbed in the face and the train being re-sealed
idk when this happened but it was before they sent in iron man guy

the train is very secure and mechanical on the inside and just looks like a very sturdy/metal train from the outside
well anyways, onto where i go in


i slash through with one try the giant ass thick ass steel(?) doors with one swipe

my sword is god mode

i swipe through the second steel door, opening the "caboose" where all the bad guys are

i turn immediately to my left and there's that asian scientist/physicist guy sitting there with someone else

right as i'm about to split the person he is sitting next to in half vertically, he calmly touches him with a taser like object (didn't emit electricity) and well that's it. he's so calm about it it's weird. the guy still dies, i split him in fucking half

i feel as though i MIGHT have turned to my right now (or turned around rather, since i am facing left at the 2) and delt with a guy over there

but anyways, the asian physicist did the same thing to himself

and i mean he was only like milliseconds before i killed him that he touched himself + the other guy
MILLISECONDS before my sword entered his brain
and he was completely unphased


i found out somehow later (unexplained) that what the device did was move your conscience over to your left elbow for 10 seconds. how that makes any sense i have no idea

his calmness stayed with him as i stared into his eyes as both halves of his body fell to the side


later, back in god-mode-observing, i fly over the train and see the rat still being tortured... but for what? i have no idea. he doesn't know we've already successfully infiltrated the train (there's like a wall/maze in between so he can't see shit)

weird fucking dream
