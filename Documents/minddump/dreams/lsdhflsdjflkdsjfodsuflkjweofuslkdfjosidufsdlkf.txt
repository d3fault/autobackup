A dream where I was 3-4 stories high on a roller coaster with some side space to stand on (the ride would pass you by a foot to your right). A tire bounced in front of the ride which was 20 feet towards reaching me (going fast) and the angle the tire would bounce off was uncalculable to my puny human brain (left? right? center?). I jumped left to dodge the tire (right would have been into the coaster's path) and upon looking left/down I feel that 4 stories down to my probable death (maybe landed in planter that maybe appeared and/or grew as I was falling)
