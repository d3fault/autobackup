Somehow my dad found out about a [drug induced] ego death, and the idea sounded very appealing to him. He talked about it like it was something he wanted to do. I was surprised that he didn't reject the idea (like I'm pretty sure he'd do IRL). I do IRL wonder if maybe the thing would help him overcome his problems, make him enjoy life more (however I also acknowledge that maybe first it would have to get [much] worse for him (the drop: aka "everything i knew was wrong")).
