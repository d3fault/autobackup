had a dream where i was going to ride my bike to an old farm house (my/our old house) in california, pack shit into the suburban, and drive back to AZ with the bike in the car. in the dream i had done that VERY VERY LONG journey a few times before

i met nick and suzy outside of his car on the way just to the store to buy a sweatshirt for wearing on the journey
we talked about stuff. idfk what.


i was too pooped after riding my bike to the store to get the sweatshirt and called it all off
the dream is probably referring to that failed backpacking trip i went on... but idfk what the rest of it is about.... weird shit...

this dream was a few nights ago
