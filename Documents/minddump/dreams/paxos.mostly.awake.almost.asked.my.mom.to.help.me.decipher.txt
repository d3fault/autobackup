when waking up this morning [my mom was there wtf], i was tempted to ask her 
something

'is this a data network or a '

i really don't know


the paxos/gfs/chubby/abc designs have been floating around in my head lately

ESPECIALLY IN MY DREAMS

i was actually pretty close to asking her this morning
but i was even tempted to ask yesterday morning



i don't know what to do

i do seem to get the answer in my sleep
but i can't even conceptualize it
gah.

i'm still a bit confused on how GFS even works
that might be intentional by google. niggers.


more or less, i don't understand the concept of a file
is that a table?

when it's modified, how does that happen?
complete rewrite (of QDataStream'd object)
or echo >> newshit;
???????

i guess one is modification and the other is appending
but they are both modifying

the fuck.
