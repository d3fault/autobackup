Went lucid and was sucked upward from where I was standing and flew through space through a wormhole of sorts. There I floated/traveled quite calmly and decided what to do with the lucidity. I summoned Kaylee for a kiss. I've been wanting to do this for some time now, seeing as it's unlikely I'll ever get to do it in a non-dream. I gave her a peck. Anti-climatic. I went in for a second. Same deal. It's not that I didn't enjoy it, I just expected to enjoy it much more. For the third I decided to slip in some tongue, because why the fuck not this isn't real life :-P. Just a tad bit of tongue yea... then the dream came to a halt. Time came to a stand still over the course of a second (one of those easing curves, the rate at which we slowed seemed to slow as we approached 0). Simultaneously during that second (or maybe it was a few seconds, w/e) she morphed into me and I stared into her left eye while kissing her still. Her/his face also became worn, similar to the boy's face over the course of the movie "Come and See". I distinctively remember crows feet. This wasn't at all confusing/alarming to me. I accepted/understood it as it happened: She is me, I am she. We are one.
