Had a dream where I had to use my throat mic because of too much background noise (this is becoming apparent in many cases, seeing as Caydon is randomly here today... and I'm guh still trying to get the video stream up (just talking to anyone in general while trying to do computer work makes the computer work much harder. on the flip side, it's nice to not have to lock my devbox whenever someone walks in)). Oh right back to the dream: yea uhh I moved it around to get the best quality. I somehow had feedback in my ear[s?] so I could adjust it realtime (I should do this). It turned out that the place the vibrations were most clearly transformed into audible sound, was when the throat mic was on my lower lip (rather than neck).
