had a dream last night where i was being chased by like 9 dudes in prison suits (inmates). there was a shit ton more to this dream, but i can't remember what it was. they had a reason for chasing me and i KNOW there was lots of shit going on before it, but i have no idea what it was.

we were on a soccer field and i had a bag on my back. in it was "stuff" and rope. as i was running i noticed that they were catching up to me so i was going to ditch the bag and keep the rope. i was fumbling with the bag and trying to get the rope out and slowing myself down more and more. i eventually just ditched the bag and tried to get them to trip over it. the people were running in a line just like on GTA 1. i knew that if i threw the bag and it slowed the first guy down that the others would just scatter around him and continue chasing. the bag did hardly anything and they caught up to me :(.

the whole point (well, the only one i can remember) is this: when you're in a dream, it's very hard to do the test of "is this a dream because i'm slowing down / running slow?" because you think that your life is in immediate danger! you don't take the chance that it isn't, and you certainly don't think about performing a test to see if it is!




another part of the dream was a party at tanner deitz's "house" (which was mainly outside and multi-levelled, kinda like his actual house except not that same place. his own)


another part was in a car with megan rich in the backseat and we like high fived while i was driving. the car was full but i can't remember any of the other 3 people



should i mention last names now that i'm pretty damn sure i'm publishing? on one hand it's "rude", on the other: it's accurate! idfk
