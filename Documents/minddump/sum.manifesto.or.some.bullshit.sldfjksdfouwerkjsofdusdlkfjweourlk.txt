The illusion of privacy brings paranoia which brings insanity. Privacy has value, which is why it has the capability of bringing about paranoia. We have entered the age of technology and there's no turning back. You can try to fight it all you want (legally and technologically), but at the end of the day it doesn't matter: the bad guys CAN and WILL hack you (I know this for a fact because I CAN hack any security ever (including my own) -- given enough time/resources. All security buys you is a finite amount of time secure. There is no security that cannot be broken with enough time/resources). Make privacy snooping illegal and only criminals (and the NSA) will privacy snoop.

I value my privacy but I'm willing to give it up entirely in order to rid myself of some paranoia.

As a human being who has spent the overwhelming vast majority of his adult (or even teenage) life in front of a computer... and who has for the most part attempted to practice privacy through means of encryption etc... that paranoia is probably taking a huge toll on my sanity. So huge I probably can't even comprehend how huge... because I've never NOT had it there (except as a child). It has been growing and growing and growing over the years and I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE.
