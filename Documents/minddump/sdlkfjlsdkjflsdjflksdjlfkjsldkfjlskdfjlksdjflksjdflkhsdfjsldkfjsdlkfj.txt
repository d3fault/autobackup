I want a news source that presents only facts (sure it would be boring to consume, but 'entertaining' is a worthwhile sacrifice). Unfortunately, it's impossible to present ideas without expression... and expression is inevitebly plagued with opinion.


I'm depressed, yea sure... but I don't want to solve that depression with happy pills. I need to logically deduce that I am happy. However I'm starting to realize that I've no option but to accept defeat against the problem that depresses me (which _ESSENTIALLY_ boils down to: "I can't persuade someone who's become successful from being greedy... to not be greedy" (because that in effect says "Pursuade someone who is successful to not want to be successful" <-whoa dis some good shit here a few tangents deep)). That fucking "Art of War" guy that I know nothing about except a few quotes here and there... said something along the lines of "If you know you're going to lose a battle/war, it's better not to fight it". Blah blah "if you can't beat em join em", too~. So does this mean I _SHOULD_ take happy pills? Fffffuck that, I can't live a life of delusion. My mind is too logical for that shit. Maybe it's sufficient for weaker minds, but mine continuously searches for truth. And I'd know in the back of my head that I'm burying the truth and chemically smothering my depression with some fucking happy pills.

I take drugs for truth. Happy pills, anti-psychotics, and probably a handful of other categories of drugs.... are running away from truths.


I see the world very logically, but I have no culture.
