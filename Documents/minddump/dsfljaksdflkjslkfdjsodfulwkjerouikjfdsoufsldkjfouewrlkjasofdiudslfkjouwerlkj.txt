I just came to the conclusion, after stating that I don't give a shit if all my files are [physically] shredded so long as I remain alive, that I will censor liberally. When in doubt, censor.

I am anti-censorship but I am moreso anti-death.
I am using life and death as they are extremes, but there are similar/less-extreme words that can be substituted in. I am just not able to substitute them in. HAH, see? Censoring myself right here and now. Fuck life [for making me censor].
