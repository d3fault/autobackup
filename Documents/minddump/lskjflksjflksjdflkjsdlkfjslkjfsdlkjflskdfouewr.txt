Be careful with your imagination, especially when documenting it. It may seem like the ultimate form of free will (and it is if you keep it private (so it isn't, because you aren't free to be public)), but the very act of documenting it can make it become real. Fly around like a F35 in your imagination, yes, but try to focus only on the good so that that's what manifests. There's infinite bad and infinite good, free will when tripping balls or lucid dreaming (or just day dreaming) must be used to keep you from writing/causing your own death.
