I'm in a scary state. A few wrong keystrokes and I'd start screaming at the top of my lungs. Sure, everything up until launch is at least replicated (phew), but still... wouldn't want to use the work since. Freenet is the only delete proof system in existence :(... but it's sooooooo fucking slooooooow. I think I'm going to post to newsgroups instead... those are delete-proof enough.
