my fault

it is my fault that my grandpa wieler isn't frozen because i did not code fast enough to get money to get respect to get influence to pursuade stupid ass capitalist christian relatives that it is smart to freeze yourself. there is still time for the other 3 grandparents.

i felt hatred towards my grandma but it was mostly misplaced

i never asked my grandpa directly if he'd freeze himself. wanted to on multiple occassions but didn't. when he was intibated and most probably sleeping, i asked him and told him to shake his right foot if he wanted to be frozen. but in retrospect he was probably too out of it.

still i can't help but think he heard me and wanted to and was too numb to move!

that was the last time i saw him. i wanted to come the next weekend to try to wake him up and ask him again but i slept in when my dad was leaving and simply didn't go.

i keep telling myself that he probably wouldn't have been down for it anyways... but that's something i'll never know...
