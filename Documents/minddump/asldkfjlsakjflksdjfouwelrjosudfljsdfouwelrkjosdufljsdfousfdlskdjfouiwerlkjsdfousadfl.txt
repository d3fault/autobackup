TODOreq: The Ultra-Paranoid's Guide To Securing Something (Bitcoin, in this example)
Joke about how step 1 is to make your own computer and software from scratch, etc...
Should talk about offline wallets, offline private signing/sending of transactions, long passwords (encryption rounds for dictionary words), wrapping yourself in foil, not trusting your monitor/hub/mouse(mouse when using keepass's "generate password" functionality)/HDMI(fuck CEC), etc

It is (I am) admittedly overly paranoid about security.... but it's better to be overly secure than slightly not secure enough (because the weakest link is always attacked first).
