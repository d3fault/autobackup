I would say that the programmer's dilemma applies to my life (since it only applies to specfic people). I do just want to go run and be with the people. A life without social interaction (which itself is the chaotic driving force of intelligence overall (i guess 'average')) is wasted. The person, who might have been smart when they split off to their own mind only, will surely eventually become stupid relative to if they would have stayed in touch with the chaotic ball of chaos (lol, i guess i mean of intelligence... but the intelligence IS chaos. your snippet of it and your discoveries would surely have been discovered by someone else given enough time (or of course, by you again and again and again)). Yes you waste time because you have to deal with stupidity, but your dealing with stupidity is the price you pay for the occassional actually intelligent discovery (be it (had: beit) a thought or... chemical accident (etc)).

I guess this is why RSS feeds to only certain sites was invented. Fuck the stupid. Still, they tend to all sell out and that usually consists of posting stupid so [almost] every RSS feed ends up sucking.
