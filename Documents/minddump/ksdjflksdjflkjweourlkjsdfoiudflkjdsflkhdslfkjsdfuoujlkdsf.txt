Shares analogy with life as well: Don't try to make lucid dreams last, they will end [shortly]. Instead just try to do whatever cool shit you can think of [and/or do, in the case of life] while you can (while it's there).


It baffles me that it's a choice. Short/interesting vs. long/boring. There's no right or wrong answer, it's just what you choose. I'm torn because I want my cake and to eat it too (long/interesting).


Life's too short to give a shit what everyone else thinks. Additionally, there are far too many people and it's not even logically possible to care what all of them think (you'll end up contradicting yourself for different people). It's only feasible to be able to care about what you yourself think (or written better: care about what you [already] care about).
