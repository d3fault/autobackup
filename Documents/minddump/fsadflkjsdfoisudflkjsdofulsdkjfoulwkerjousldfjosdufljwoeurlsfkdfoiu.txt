My life feels like schrodinger's box cat at times... unfolding/being-created as I experience it. Movies especially seem like they're being created by my deepest personal (private (for now)) thoughts. Proving one way or the other is impossible, but I _THINK_ that it is false. I _THINK_ that this shit is being experienced... not made up. No proof of it of course but it makes things more interesting. If everything's a cat in a box then I have no need or reason to interact with peers ever.
