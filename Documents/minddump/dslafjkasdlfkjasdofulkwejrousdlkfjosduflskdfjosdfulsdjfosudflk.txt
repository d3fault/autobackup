I know what death is like. You know when you're drowsy/heavy from anisthetics? Multiply that by a thousand and reverse-exponentially bring time to zero. Death is the ring in your ears after a shotgun has been fired too close to your head. Except instead of slowly fading out it is the only/last thing you hear. Death removes all relativity. You see the universe absolutely. You see our role as humans on earth (nothing, but you see how obsessed and blind we become by it (because of relativity (it is all we know))). You feel more sad than ever before as you understand and accept that this is it for you. Tears would be flowing like a river, more than you've ever cried before, if only your brain could still control your tear ducts. Watery heavy gutwrenching doom. Your brain (possibly through the use of drugs (but really, what is drugs?)) does it's best to slow down time during these last moments. You could see everything from the big bang up to your death, or just from birth to death. YOU decide what your last trip is like, though probably subconsciously (or perhaps the forelobe and subconscious finally/for-the-first-time meet and merge?).
