STAND UP AND DANCE
that is all you can do
i mean sure code too
whatever
sameshit
do your jig
cling as much as you can
you've probably been here before.

just sayin
yea it feels good and all
but it *might* not last
realistically

but that also means i'll be here again
oh god
savor it
ya know?
make it last
or just enjoy it
what is the difference?
when negative becomes positive and positive becomes negative
infinitely
might as well just ENJOY every minute of it
sure, cling too
but don't let that depress you
it isn't worth it
it'll just ruin it

cling for the sake of progress
for the hope of progress
nothing more
