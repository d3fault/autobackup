"Using other people's logic against them" is really the ONLY way to have an argument/discussion.... because otherwise they don't/can't understand you.


Working for yourself is difficult because you always owe yourself nothing. You don't owe yourself money, and yourself doesn't owe you money (lol this doesn't make sense, but that's the point: always at zero. when you are employed, you feel a bit of guilt that you're being paid [by someone else]... and so you work).
