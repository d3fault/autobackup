There needs (and I mean needs like a human needs oxygen. this is REALLY fucking important) to be a constitutional amendment or whatever (one of those "high up" laws that the "lower" laws aren't allowed to contradict) that says: "no law is allowed to exist unless it prevents evil". Democracy is just too damn powerful (but funnily/luckily-enough, powerful enough to enact this described amendment :-P): democracy can declare vanilla icecream the best ice cream and declare chocolate icecream illegal. We need to surrender some of the power that democracy gives us. Another arbitrary example is pants: it's not evil to not wear pants, therefore it should be legal to not wear pants. We were born without pants, we evolved without pants, why the fuck are pants necessary aside from some group saying "pants is better than no pants, therefore no pants should be illegal". This is unjust. An aside: I chose pants as an arbitrary example; tbh I don't give a shit whether or not I'm wearing pants. I tend to "forget" that I'm wearing pants because I get used to them, so it's not really an issue that should be pressed. It is an example and nothing more. There are much more important things that the amendment at the core of this document would solve.
