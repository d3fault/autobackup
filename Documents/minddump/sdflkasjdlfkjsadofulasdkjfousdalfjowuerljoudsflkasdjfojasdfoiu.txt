These two defenses I was saving in mah brain and was planning on delivering "at the right moment", but eh I don't trust myself to not forget them so fuggit.

Crypto Export: We have the right to secure our money, since the government can't/won't [insure more than $250k]. We have the right to secure out money, and we have the right to travel abroad. Travelling abroad and securing your money means you carry the crypto routines on your persons on the plane ride and bam now you are guilty of treason and get the death penalty. It's just a dumb and outdated law, should be fixed soon iHope.

Obscenity: NSA can/does warrantlessly wiretap US citizens or anyone they damn please. Being obscene privately is legal, but NSA watching you masturbate makes you paranoid as fuck so now you are forced to live publically. "Living publically", anything that used to be "obscene" (which means you can't record/publish/etc it, but CAN _do_ it) is now illegal outright, which is utter fucking bullshit. I have the right to fist anyone I damn well please (so long as they are consenting).
