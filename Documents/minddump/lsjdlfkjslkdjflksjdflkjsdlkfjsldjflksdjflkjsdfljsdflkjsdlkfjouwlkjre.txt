Fuck joining the military/cia/nsa/etc (I know I'm smart enough). What are they protecting? A sea of humans trying to earn money. What are they earning money for? Their kids so they can raise them well and give them a good opportunity to do well in life. To do well at what? Making money [for their kids]. Most everybody lives for someone else.
