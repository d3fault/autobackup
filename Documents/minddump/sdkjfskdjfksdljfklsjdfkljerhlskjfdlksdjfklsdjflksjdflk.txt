That among these inalienable rights are the right to a life of slavery, and the pursuit of enslaving others.


Saw a video the other day of some Haitians beating the shit out of some guy that allegedly stole some bananas from a banana field. Towards the end I had this thought: beating that man is unethical and immoral (obviously), but if they DON'T do it, they risk starving to death themselves. They might be (or want to be) good people, but the struggle to survive FORCES them to be evil. If they don't punish thiefs for stealing, thieves will steal everything and they starve to death. There is no way to solve this general problem without changing the system entirely.
