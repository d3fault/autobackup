baby steps
"YAT" isn't so bad

as long as you HAVE a tangent
and it DOES connect back
it isn't SOOOO bad

it's just time consuming :(

baby steps

tangents, of the prototype family, are very good thing
they propel you forward
even if they don't appear to do so

they are depressing

they are necessary

they are helpful

they are your favorite coding style, even if you don't like them

"rapid prototyping" = FTW
