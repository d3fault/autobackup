When I was trippin yesterday, there was a point I was staring down and to the left (after I stared at the asterisk). I was staring at my left index finger's knuckle (the one closer to my wrist). There was like a circle of clarity surrounding it, and everything else was blurred (I was probably seeing through my focus point in my eyes). I just looked at it very vividly and saw the patterns in my skin. Knuckleprint (it wasn't moving [much?] at this point, not like my fingerprints :)). It was during that staring that I said I was confronting (or what did I say? I forget) fear.
