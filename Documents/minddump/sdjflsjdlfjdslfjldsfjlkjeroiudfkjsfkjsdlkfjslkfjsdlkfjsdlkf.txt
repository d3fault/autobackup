The craziest idea is that supply & demand dictates every aspect of our lives, and the scariest fact is that it does.


In theory we have a logical/emotional wall of thoughtful beings (politicians) protecting us from the thoughtless marketplace, but in practice supply & demand dictates every aspect of their lives even moreso than ours.

Let's ignore the "approached" concept for the duration of this document.
