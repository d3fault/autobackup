business-politics submission pyramid

Donald Trump is so good at getting that he got [to rule] the largest business-politics submission pyramid on Earth.

there are potentially an infinite number of different kinds of sub-submissionPyramid(s) for a given submission pyramid. submission periods are made up of either a) human beings, or b) other submission pyramids.

There are usually human links between submission pyramids (and parent/child submission pyramids), but actually with the advent of computer programming and the internet, submission pyramids (had:periods), namely their distribution of power they posess, can be automatically linked together. Everything is sort of already linked, but it's event-driven and humans are transcribing things verbatim rather than them being properly linked. man I can't remember my point.
