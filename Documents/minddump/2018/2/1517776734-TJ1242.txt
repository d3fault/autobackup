I'm honestly primarily a backend coder, frontend magic doesn't impress me much (but I mean tbh yea ofc "demos" scene is fucking amazing man. "all that in 4kb!?!?!?"). format2ui is a fucking KISS/minimalist "format" that converts into a CLI ui and  GUI gui. other convertion outputs are possible and may happen, but I don't give a shit about them [yet]. There's just so much fucking GLUE/DUPE code when you are setting up a generic-as-fuck (same as last time) UI to query the user for fucking variables. I also have to make a decision between "cli" or "gui" (qt widgets), and cli is honestly the more portable in terms of programming/scripting. ODR: ONE FUCKING DEFINITION RULE. format2ui is my attempt at putting my "usual" ui format (a fucking vertical box of 'widgets') into a format which, needing only be defined once, can convert/output itself into both cli and gui (and others, which may not even exist yet!!!!!!!!!111111elevenSeriouslyThisIsKeyAsFuck_QML2Bloated) into a gui implementation.

my point is that since I'm primarily a backend coder, I can get away with EXTREMELEY BASIC (mostly just strings, ints, and string/int lists etc blah so ez (I guess I should code to handle a QVariantList (which possibly points to a QVariantList), since almost everything in Qt can be converted to that)? TODOmb)

my UIs are almost always extremeley basic and extremely repetetive (of each other) and therefore extremely time wasting
