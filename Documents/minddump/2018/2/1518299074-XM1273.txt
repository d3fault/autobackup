My advice to would-be revolutionaries (myself 5-10 years ago):

before you throw your little revolution, first solve the more general problem of "how do you keep corruption out of a (any) government system?". It has yet to be solved, so your revolution might buy a temporary state of what you consider to be better, but ultimately over time corruption always penetrates the system and a new revolution is needed: congrats, you[r system] became the enemy (but probably not 'you' per se, as you have probably died of old age; just the government you erected couldn't resist corruption is what became the new enemy).
