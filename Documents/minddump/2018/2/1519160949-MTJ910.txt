Said this on DDRace a few months ago to someone (I forget who): 99% Luck, 99% Skill.
They lol'd at my maths ;-P.
But anyways I think that describes life perfectly. It doesn't make any fucking sense, but that describes life perfectly: chaotic carrot/stick experience simulator/generator (one or the other or both or similar or idfk. possibly even just a "viewer" that so immersive we forgot we're only watching a life: it feels real and became our only [known/remembered] reality) with RNG filter attached.

But yea a lot of parts in DDRace seem like they take a GOOD amount of luck _AND_ a GOOD amount of skill. Like you gotta have the skill to repeatedly do the part within a certain "range" of pixels and then you have to do it N times until you get lucky and do it the perfect amount of pixels so that you finish the part. For example you have to throw (or carry etc) a tee through some tunnel with death tiles on the top and bottom. The better you are, the quicker you'll get lucky and do the part.

A lot of the [Novice-Moderate] parts on DDRace are not like this: most of them are very easily oneshot-able (two is pussy)... but when you get to harder maps, you realize that luck factors in and you have to be pretty patient/diligent to pass parts, beat levels, get points, get the girls, and win at life.
