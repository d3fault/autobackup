wrote this a few weeks back: It's what I could fantacize in my wildest dreams.

wrote this a few days ago (yesterday?), directly underneath the above one, simply because it was the best spot for me to write it, realizing only afterwards that they are both related [to dreams/each-other]: the best dreams are the ones that are implementable.
^the context for this one was actually CODE! I think of software ideas and wake up and code them because they "compiled" in my dreams and so still do after I wake up (assuming I remember them). However, arguably (and I'd argue yes, while acknowledging it isn't the majority opinion) we _are_ code so it does tie in perfectly with the first line of this doc!

said this to arby a few weeks back: if you have no regrets, you _probably_ did the right thing.
^the context was whether or not he regretted decapitating his sick-as-fuck preying mantis
but still it's a slippery slope to give people that much leeway. it would be used irresponsibly far too often. a serial killer sometimes genuinely has no remorse, for example -- so he's disqualified from using the phrase.
it's to be applied lightly after a very serious decision was made. here's the model example of that: a life threatening attack that you defended yourself from by using a gun and killing the assailant. you probably aren't going to "regret" doing it (even if you do feel bad that the other person is now dead), so you'll reason with yourself that you [probably] did the right thing (in this case, you almost certainly did [unless you a scum bag worse than the one who tried to git u]). I would have felt bad if arby regretted killing daisy, because I kinda persuaded him into doing it (and hell, even helped with the act (he was botching the kill)).

ot as fuck: there is a spider in my keyboard that just climbed up my finger then back down into the keyboard rofl awesome
