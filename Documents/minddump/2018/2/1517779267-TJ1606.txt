Code Generators are probably one of the most DULL-YET-VALUABLE things to code. you literally are just transcribing raw text into "characters sent to stdout (via QTextStream)", escaping bullshit newlines etc etc it's so fucking boring there's no oomf to it....... but you continue through the boringness in order to get a fucking tool (a code generator) that does in fact save you tons of time (unless it's a shitty code generator).
