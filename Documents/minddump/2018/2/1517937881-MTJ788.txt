Rabbit holes are arbitrary. They go in whichever direction you dig them. How far does the rabbit hole go? It's not a matter of distance, it's a matter of time. The rabbit hole goes until death [if you will it].


My collection of software (incl that which I import) is a metaphorical giant spherical cavity in the ground, dug by a rabbit. It's a fucking chill hangout spot yo. Chill smoke weed code chill more etc repeat.
