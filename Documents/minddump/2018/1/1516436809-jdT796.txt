went to a trampoline park while in az. I wanted to, and may have even attempted, and may have even executed (sans landing) 2x 360 front flips. as in, back to back, 2 jumps back to back without stopping in between. so I landed the first 360 front flip but not the 2nd because tbh man by then I was fucking dizzy as all hell. if it weren't a trampoline park, I would have fallen off the trampoline and gotten hurt.

fantasy realized.
