Don't judge a book by it's cover? My experiences speak differently. It's not totally foolproof, but I think you can estimate a person by their appearance. This is very shitty writing so far, so I want to narrow it the fuck down to ONLY what I'm trying to say: I think I can spot a "nice" girl from a "mean" girl by reading their FACE. has nothing (very little?) to do with how they dress/do-makeup etc, everything is in the face. Namely, the smile and the eyes pretty much tell the whole story. I can spot a genuine smile I think, and eyes play a big part of that.

Mean girls, aka sociopaths and manipulative cunts, have guilty subconsciences. Their [guilty] subconscience expresses itself _IN_ their smile and eyes! They can't help it [unless they're EXTREMELY good at lying].

But I guess I should mention that yea clothing does factor in (but this applies to boys and girls both): 'good' people dress with lighter colors in general, 'bad' people (or good people in a bad mood, such as funerals) tend to dress in darker colors. Again, all probably subconscious.
