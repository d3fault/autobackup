I'm finally back in cali. feels like the last 2 months were.... idfk. Hard to even explain. lows and highs. next time I'm renting a car. having my camper there was convenient but trippy. I crossed streams. I kept worrying I'd break down and get stuck in az. I admit a part of me (at least 10%) wanted to stay there (reason:family).

It's been less than 6 hours since I've crossed the Yuma <--> Winterhaven border but I've already accomplished more than in all the time I spent in AZ. I ordered some fukken bullshit for my solar panel system/project.

OT: wowow system == project

I added the "OT" prefix after the fact.


to be fair, I did drill 4 holes into my truckbed using my grandpa's drill (also for the sola system/project). +r

who the fuck are you? I write for myself.

I write for my own understanding, but I fathom that Nick Goulian understand would everything I say with ease (if he were to invest (waste?) the time to understand it).

yea old news is old "i write for myself"


hmm anyways somke weed every day
yea typos are noe teven wrok it.
`not even worth it`

ok eat shit I have to be babel blto duneerstand it later ya know?
so typos are not actually acceptable at all. I mean I guess some but it's extremely difficult to instantly contemplate every implication of every typo as they happen. much easier to simply be accurate.
