That I publish code/docs is merely a side effect of my existence. Keeping shit private/encrypted makes me paranoid to the point where I want to blow my fucking brains out. I know this to be true because I used to be at that point. That shitty failure of a "launch" ~3 years ago was when I started publishing shit. Quality of life significantly improved, despite not being anywhere nearly as successful as I was wanting it to be.
