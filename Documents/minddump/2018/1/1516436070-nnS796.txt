I don't want to think of impossibilities because that shit won't compile.
I don't like to, that is.

I bounce off the railings separating possible/impossible and then cross a metaphorical boxing ring and then bounce off the elastic railings again. I stay within the realm of possible THOUGHT because I am a programmer and it is possible for me to be able to be sitting at a single point and able to do anything [possible], given enough time, and to achieve it because I know the boundaries of programming (and if anything, they will expand [I think/hope]) so my thoughts are progress forwards. they are "actions". they are almost never not possible, unless accidentally so or maybe equivalent to "not possible" because after more thought they are realized to be too difficult or too time consuming to implement [in code].

That's what I'm doing in my mind. Just parkour thoughts back and forth bouncing off fuck it 45 degrees trampolines separated by a few horizontal trampolines.

music.

damn reminds me I _NEEEEEEED_ to code MusicFingers.
