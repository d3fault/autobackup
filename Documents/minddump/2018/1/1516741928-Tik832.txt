I want to section hike the Pacific Crest Trail, but for now I'm simply section hiking all the various cities in California. Skateboard too. It's kinda fun, but tbh not that fun: just endless stores and people I don't know how to communicate with. It's also a good/safe way to get in shape for section hiking the PCT! On the PCT when you under pack/prepare, you risk dying. In a city though, you walk to the nearest gas station/etc and get some tasty drink etc and sit on a bench in the shade while you regain your energy: you also have the option of taking a bus back to your base (in my case, my camper is my base). It's so safe in fact that when I go walking/skateboarding, I often times allow myself to not bring water (sometimes it's accidental and I don't even notice). I try not to go into gas stations etc unless I need to, but there's a COMFORT FACTOR of knowing they are there that helps you EASILY walk ~10 miles without taking a sip of water (ok I'm a camel so this probably doesn't apply to you). There's no way in hell I'd go even ~1 mile in the wilderness without water, but in the cities I find myself going for many miles and many hours without even the urge to drink water. The lack of fear from dehydration solved by the gas stations on every other corner.

Cities suck though, I should [section|thru] hike the PCT and do fantacize about it often. I want to wear wasdf and live stream the entire trip though kekek I am in dependency hell.
