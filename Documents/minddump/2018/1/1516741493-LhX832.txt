If it weren't for precum, the population of earth would be an order of magnitude less. The average parent would also be more responsible (in general) and prepared (for the enormous task of raising a child).

So, is precum an evolutionary advantage or disadvantage?
It's an advantage if your species is having difficulty not going extinct, but it's a disadvantage once the species escapes the risk of extinction (from too small a population): too many teenagers seeking pleasure (nothing wrong with that) are suddenly/practically-instantaneously (~9mo) tasked with one of the most challenging things on the face of the planet: raising a child.
