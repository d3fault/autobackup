You don't gotta, but you don't gotta not either.
The first context happened to be smokin weed (but there was no mention of weed in the sentence), but I like it in the abstract form better. The way I wrote it on my whiteboard mentioned weed: you don't gotta get high, but you don't gotta not get high either.

We describe it as unquantifiable? Isn't that the same as describing it as undescribable?


Embedded in chemicals
suspended?

Embedded sounds neater. The orig context was ink on a piece of paper, but I like the abstract form better. "We are embedded in chemicals". Life/consciousness is embedded in chemicals (brain tissue carried by a bipedal organic robot with a penis).
