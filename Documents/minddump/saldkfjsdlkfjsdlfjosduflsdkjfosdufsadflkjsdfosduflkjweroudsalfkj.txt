kind of want to do chemistry and err like meh limited time thus finite knowledge


but what i was thinking about, which might not even make any sense, is like a 'database of all chemical structures' with computer software automation ability to create any structure (this would also imply INCOMING resources somehow (though theoretically/REALISTICALLY everything can be created from hydrogen))

so like a randomization process


i need to both KNOW what drug i am consuming but keep the audience unaware
and still be in 100% mode?

is that a contradiction?



am i willing to break 100% mode and/or to contradict myself for drugs? i really don't know the answer to this



THOUGH I CERTAINLY WOULD RATHER BREAK 100% MODE THAN GO TO PRISON~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



does it boil down to choose one?
a) 100% mode, no drugs
b) 99% mode, drugs




Fuck.


at least weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed is legal omfg that makes me so fucking happy :) you have no idea future peoples. i guess it's equivalent to my being born into legal alcohol (though weed is a million times better hahahahaha)



i guess really it also comes down to WHAT drugs i want to consume.



yes i do want to try just about every drug ever....
.... but eh, that would surely result in detainment.




i think there's a slight possibility that weed + 5meo-dmt could be.... ignored. owning the frog is legal and i guess i just have to consume it before the detainers arrive? shit needs to dry out so this sucks.


MAYBE A COMPUTER/ROBOT TO EXTRACT PERIODICALLY THE SHIT?

this is in it's own weird way a form of the chemical element generator mentioned in the beginning of this doc
