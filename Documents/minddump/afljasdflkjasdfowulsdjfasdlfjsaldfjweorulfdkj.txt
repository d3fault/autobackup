slow and steady, just like that fucking turtle
turns out i do need to implement an ack layer for my rpc connection management shit

been stuck on this probably for so long, but glad I at least know now

slow and steady

I feel like after this rpc connection shit it'll be a nice downhill ride to riches (i'll probably be proven wrong)


an afterthought to my research into tcp's ack'ing... it's the compress+encrypted (from ssl) byte size anyways that it's acking (or does that even matter? probably not now that i think about it fuck this sentence...)
