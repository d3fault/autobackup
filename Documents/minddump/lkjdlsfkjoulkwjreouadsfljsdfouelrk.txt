a) to escape paranoia of being jacked
b) to escape relative certainty of assassination


solution to both: live-publish-anon+signed
cons: no 'name' for 'rallying behind'. not fulfilling the idea in my 'trips', perhaps keeping me from progressing? voice + video can't be done anon (even text will be difficult (we each have our own way of speaking)). a new kind of paranoia that i will be discovered and outed, associated with my words (possibly even with a stupid punishment attached at this point (the world is illogical)).










i have to be public
because i cannot code softwares otherwise
i can't "start"
the whole point of it is documenting the creation of it
doing it in private is not an option

creating it live will mean raids accomplish nothing
the knowledge will be out there
the code will be out there
the design will be out there
ETC

this is vital
i also think it would be cool to record/broadcast a raid as it is happening :-P
all of the juicy details (which are usually sat on by corporations) will be available to the public eye
"was he being legal? yes i can determine for myself that he definitely was. thus, that raid is illegal"
vs. like tiny bits of information with the kim dotcom raid being made available
