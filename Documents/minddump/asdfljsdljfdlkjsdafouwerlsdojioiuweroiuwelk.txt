frozing myself is SUUUUCH a longshot that i do believe infinite multiverse theory probably needs to exist
actually i don't believe that but this document sounds much better if i do
ignoring the directly above line: i might as well live my pre-frozing life on full blast because infinite multiverse theory must exist ANYWAYS for post-frozing to happen
the end
end of logic
ignore that bit of contradiction/explaination if you want the fancy schmancy cool sounding version
sorry but i play my own devil's advocate
i detect my own bugs in my design as i am designing my designs (software)
piss off you lower minded 
person.
