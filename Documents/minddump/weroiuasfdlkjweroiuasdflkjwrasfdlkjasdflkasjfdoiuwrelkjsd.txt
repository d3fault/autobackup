Section 3.2 - Data Flow

"To fully utilize each machine's network bandwidth, the data is pushed linearly"
...
"rather than divided among multiple recipients"


the design and functionality of the network as a whole can stay the change

but toggling between each of those two would be handy


the first one is good for if your cluster is on a LAN
the latter is better for if your cluster is on a WAN


linear: client pings each replica, creates pipeline based on that. lowest latency = closest
multiple: p2p bittorrent superseed. the data spreads across a larger (geographically speaking) network faster.




in a WAN environment if you were to do linear, you'd have to wait for every single server to get there copy
well maybe not but the last server in the chain would depend on everyone in between him and the first
they have to get every piece before he does

superseed will have the last server in the line contributing (coincidentally, the last part of the file) to every node (except the node it gave to them)
so each node uses a good amount of up/down simultaneously




it can be a radio toggle in a hypothetical admin app (which i'd imagine communicates with the master?)
could even in theory switch the mode at runtime
but what's the point of that...


a better feature would be to be able to map out which are in a LAN and which are over a WAN and to select the appropriate one automatically
