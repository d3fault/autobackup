Or do I have too much content that is neither cussing, porn, nudity, etc... that I can't afford to censor myself anyways. As in, I CAN censor myself (nudity, porn, cussing even, etc).... but I have way too much "mean" or "rude" (blah blah blah) content that I'm absolutely not willint to censor....... and that content will ruin my name EITHER FUCKING WAY. However that only affects the children argument, not the Kaylee one. I think she mostly only cares about porn: cussing is tolerable and so is nudism (educated guesses). Does the material matter most? Material should certainly be judged independently, but we all know it isn't. "Movie Production Companies" can make rated R movies with porn in them and also rated G movies with kid shit... and not get the "censor stick" / name ruined. HOWEVER that same statement does not happen with individuals! If you are known for rated R porn/etc then people aren't going to let their children watch your rated G movies (and also "entities" will censor you too). This is bullshit but true.
