by serializing the svg into couchbase json documents
it is easy to make a backwards compatible z realtime-addin
and also to update the xyz coords of the "group" of "svg-items" that represent "ME"
in a synchronized/distributed/scalable/alwaysOnline/alwaysUpdateable way
just like d3fault
because it will use/be d3fault
i'm tired of my life
i'm tired of dying while doing nothing

i mean yes i am actively working towards something
but gah i feel like i am impatient as fuck
ya know?
so hard to keep my cool
so hard to stay calm
hack on
shit's boring, fun, and necessary at the same time
i need to 'get money out of the way'
but i also feel like i'm under a rock
and will never make it
so i'm tempted to burst through
break on through to the other side
throw it all up in the air
but then what will i DO
at least this way i know a linear path to my goals
that's all that's needed...
why would i throw it all up in the air?
pointless.



so close i can taste it
mmmmmmmmmmmmm
success~

gg noobs

lol fucking noob
stop fantasizing
get back to coding
you're taking such a big tangent with this QuickDirtyAutoBackupHalper
but i do feel it will be worth it in the end :)
it's quick, it's dirty, it's ALMOST DONE (just need to do commit slot), and it's going to be functional
it will save time and allow me to commit when using my sync-to-backups-strategy without losing the ability to customize the commit message. but also makes it optional for if i don't know what to put because they're just a series of text document commits
hell i can add containers at any time and git push will push all the shit.
fuck yea!
so pro as fuck shiiiiit yea
but lol this isn't going to get you any dollars
