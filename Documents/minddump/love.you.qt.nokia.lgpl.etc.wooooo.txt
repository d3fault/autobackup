i just want to take a moment to say how awesome i think qt is. nokia gets much respect from me for backing/making/researching/doing/etc qt. i plan to make qt the base of my work for the rest of my life. i just hope i can base something in between there because writing in C++ is too tedious. i love that qt is LGPL and i want to continue/further their effort by releasing all my shit as LGPL. i believe it is reasonable to profit from a market while supporting/furthering the lgpl movement. lgpl is without a doubt the best license (well i mean all similar licenses too) ever. businesses can use it, gpl peeps can use it.. win/win. everybody can contribute. lgpl communities fucking skyrocket. fuck this gpl bullshit... you lose so much business interest with that shit.
