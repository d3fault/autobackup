I try really hard always because there is finite time for me to try, and the harder I try, the further I increase of chance becoming indefinite.



I AM PRIVELEDGED AS A PROGRAMMER (INCENTIVE TO CODE) BECAUSE I (AS A SPECIES) HAVE NOT YET INVENTED/DISCOVERED/SOLVED "INDEFINITE" LIVING
uJelly, POST-INDEFINITE c0d3rz that can't get "into" it the same as us originals?


TRYING REALLY HARD will become programmed into my frozen'd brain and I will be one of the few who are in that mode by default and fucking love it

I will make programming incredibly fucking fast my default mode of operation
