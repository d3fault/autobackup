Anonymous Bitcoin Computing - Open source advertising platform for buying and selling ads. 1.5% transaction fee and 1.5% withdrawal fee. Advertise on regular websites or tor hidden services (anything legal). It works like this: the cost to rent ad space increases exponentially (doubles) every time an ad time slice is reserved, then trickles back down (linearly) to your minimum set price and settles back on it the moment the last queued ad expires. This algorithm ensures your ads are always purchased, while still making advertisers compete with each other for your ad space.
