a dht need only rely on a starting point that marks what time it is and then the client has their time sync'd with that starting point
it boils down to: whoever has the most "no, that group is lying" 's is the true dht owner
it can obviously be gamed

bitcoin "deals with" this problem by changing it into: whoever has the most sheer resources owns the network
wasteful, but sounds like it could work in theory. definitely can also be gamed..
