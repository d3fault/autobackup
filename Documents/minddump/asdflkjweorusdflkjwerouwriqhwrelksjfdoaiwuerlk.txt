population control + unlimited test babies

you either get
a) one child, never tested
b) multiple children, each tested (until one dies from tests, then the rest
already born don't have to do any tests. if more babies, then we resume testing
all the babies, picking up where we left off... where we would have continued
if we didn't stop because of the death of one of the other siblings)


loophole:
have a kid
wait 10 years
have another kid
are we going to now do testing on the 10 year old?

idea sucks.
(the reason i chose babies was so they won't know what's going on. ignorance is
bliss)
