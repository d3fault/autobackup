I am 24 years old and am deciding to stop calculating "else" statements in my day to day thoughts. Will still do it where appropriate in programming (it is a side effect from that world). The reason being: there are infinite elses and I am only alive for a finite amount of time. This is the only way I know how to utilize free will. I tend to give myself "else" statements trying to utilize free will "DO THIS1 (saying to myself) OR ELSE THIS2". First of all the or else is usually almost always ignored.... and second I should not give myself the possibility of going down the else to begin with.

I wish I wasn't so emotionally impulsive, but that would require me to not have emotion and so life would be boring. (an infinite empty while loop on a cpu (err I guess "indefinite". you still die when unplugged or w/e) that the compiler does not optimize out).
