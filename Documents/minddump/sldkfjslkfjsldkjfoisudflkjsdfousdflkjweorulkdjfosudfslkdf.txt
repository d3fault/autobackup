[Probably] can't bring secure money linux box through airport security (lol writing):

Idk there's not much to write about here except that you can't go anywhere that requires putting your shit (box + keyboard) through a conveyer belt. You cannot ever let the box out of your sight or else your money is compromised. You might be able to put it in one of those "keys" jars that never leave your sight, but it's easy for my paranoid mind to think that a conveyer belt could have a trap door in it and your box be swapped out for some tampered device that looks identical. I believe the government needs to adjust the policies/procedures for a person to have a secure box on their persons and still be able to use an airport/etc.
