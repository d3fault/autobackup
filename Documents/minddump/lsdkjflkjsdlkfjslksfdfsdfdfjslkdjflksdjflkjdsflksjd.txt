Even though I'm not rejecting my government (despite having tons of reasons to do so (unfortunately, tons of reasons not to do so as well)), I'm definitely rejecting traditional copyrights. I'm creating an information bubble (only one in it atm (but I've pulled other people's content into it with me)) where information can be modified and shared freely. Funny, I just realized that "modifying" and "sharing" is more or less what evolution does to strands of DNA.
