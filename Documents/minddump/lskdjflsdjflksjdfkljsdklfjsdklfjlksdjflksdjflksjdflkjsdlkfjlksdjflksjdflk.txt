Just as you can't "teach an old dog new tricks", you also can't even show a 1 year old an alien society without them being afraid-as-fuck (tm) for at least a few seconds. We are afraid of everything by default. We are forced to face our fears and we learn about our environment and that not everything is worth fearing. How fearless we become varies wildly, but I think on average we err on the side of more fearful than not (evolution/math makes that so (had: dictates that that is so)).
