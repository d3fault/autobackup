Arguing is almost always a waste of time. In the easiest example, it is a waste of time if the person you are arguing with will not (denial etc) change their mind. Additionally, it is a waste of time if winning the argument brings about no benefit to you. You invest TIME in your argument, and you need a return on it. It would be very easy to walk about the planet arguing with everyone over everything and justifying it to yourself by saying "I am improving intelligence of the average person throughout the planet". You wouldn't be wrong in that claim, you'd just be wasting your life. Live for yourself. Our time alive is so incredibly short that you should refrain from most arguments and rationalize doing so under the category of "prioritization".
