Previous doc is both fancy poetic post-human age relevant ("I wouldn't want to fight someone with love on their side")... and primitive early evolutionary relevant. A "mom" (assuming gender even exists at this point (but hey, aren't mom's the main carrier of "love" these days (YES (love you mom)))) that doesn't show love/guilt toward her newborn.... ceases to pass on her genetic identity. If she doesn't feel love/guilt, the baby starves to death or gets eaten by some other animal or whatever and the DNA of that species dies off.

Love and guilt aren't necessarily the same thing, but I think they share some of the same evolutionary roots. Sort of like how 'fear of death' = 'appreciation of life'.


Love, like life and consciousness, has to exist.

Btw/semi-OT: Re: The only thing certain is death and taxes. I say bullshit: the only thing certain is life. Death can hypothetically be evaded (life CANNOT be hypothetically evaded because you have to first be alive in order to evade ANYTHING) (though boredom becomes a huge problem ;-P), and taxes are only "necessary" in stupid primitive societies (like this one).
