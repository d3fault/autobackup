it would definitely need to start out as a business relationship
but could eventually lead to friendship and probably sex
she'd get turned on by doing her hobby

she'd basically just need to make me presentable as 'god'
even though i will make no such claims
i've decided
maybe say we are all gods
but definitely don't proclaim yourself a god
dat shiat will get you killed

why molly in particular?
because you know her?
could find someone else

'fashion' does actually take some reasonable amount of intelligence
and a lot of snootiness to boot

that and... yea... i know her :-/
and just saw her sleepy wine lipped picture on her facebook

she is pretty damn hot
shit is, pretty damn hot
shit is pretty damn hot
she is, indeed, pretty damn hot.
lol shit
