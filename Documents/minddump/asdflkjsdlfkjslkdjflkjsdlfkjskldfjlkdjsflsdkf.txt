The big bang occurs when half of all matter in existence meets with mathematical perfection the opposite half of all matter in existence. This probably happens inside a black hole (and perhaps right when that black hole sucks up the last few pieces of matter in the universe (even if not "right when", there are no observers to time so it is irrelevant how long it takes for that perfect alignment/collission to occur)).

It may very well be two spirals going in opposite directions yet sharing a center of gravity (and therefore shrinking (and bouncing and continuing whenever an imperfect shrunken state occurs) onto each other. This is how I originally imagined it while watching Galaxy screensaver, but it needn't necessarily be circular (the innards of a black hole are a mystery to me/us).
