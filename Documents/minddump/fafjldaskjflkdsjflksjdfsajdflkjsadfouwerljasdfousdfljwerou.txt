I like how the Rapid Prototyping development model fits to fucking nicely with Tangents. I mean, they are practically the same fucking thing... aside from your perception. When I need to develop a new feature, I break out (tangent) into a new project and prototype it. Then I integrate it (err, close parenthesis in tangent? idfk). Idk lol I just like tangents and the rapid prototyping development model.
