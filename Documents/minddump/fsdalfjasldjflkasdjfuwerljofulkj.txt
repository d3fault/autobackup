if a world collapse (economic collapse) happens, WHO GIVES A FUCK
the only thing that matters is that the information required for an individual to build a self sustaining environment is out there
whether it's "copyrighted" or not is completely irrelevant. when it's a survival issue, i find it quite hard to believe a person would say "oh can't use that recipe, i'd be breaching copyright!"
still, just to help it spread about the internets/idea-web easier/faster, it should be licensed LIBRE (BY-SA for all content, LGPL for all software)
i plan to, out of sheer fucking boredom and curiosity and a self test i suppose... create said plans/documents/designs/instructions/etc
"money" becomes irrelevant once you have your bare essentials for surviving
air, water, food
air = plenty of it in the atmosphere. plant some trees to ensure it always stays that way
water = catch it right out of thin fucking air, live next to the sea and it's unlimited (requires POWER of some sort to get the salt out), live next to a river and you're pretty much fucking set indefinitely
food = automated farms or stem cell research meat farms. this is the most challenging but it is definitely possible
