In Dr. No, no said that the successful villain has to be more intelligent. This made/makes sense at first, but after thinking about it more I'm going to call bullshit. First I'll explain why it appears to make sense: villains have to be smarter than good guys in order to not get caught by good guys, derp.

Why it is not true: being evil is much easier than being good. Following the rules and doing shit by the books slows them/us down a metric fuck ton, whereas evil people disregard them on a whim. That one octavia bitch from rome tv series: "easy is it to climb down into hell... for the gates are always open. climbing back out, that's the real challenge".

So tl;dr: good have a huge handicap (or do I have that backwards? I forget what handicap means... think I got it right though)
