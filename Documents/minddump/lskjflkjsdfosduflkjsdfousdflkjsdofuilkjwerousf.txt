Launching is no longer not an option because the paranoia is ingrained in my being. The environment is only getting worse LMFAO @ the recent game console announced with an always on microphone (even when the console is off). Stupid.

I don't think I could survive with a phone with 2 cameras (front and back). Glad I bought mine before the front facing cameras became the norm. I always make sure my phone is on it's back before I start coding etc (but I mean.... tiny cameras EVERYWHERE makes that irrelevant anyways).
