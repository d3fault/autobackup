i was just lookin for a web page that i use to do research
i instinctively was about to type in icefilms
but then i realized that icefilms is not research
icefilms is only if i have something i can refer to
there are no sites i go to for research
i don't learn anything
i only explore my own brain
kinda sucks that this is what it boils down to
but i do think it is is of use to acknowledge that fact
i only explore my own brain
sorry had to say it twice to make it stick

i'm so fucking bored of everything
i want more
