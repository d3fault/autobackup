What I learned from Abc2 is that QSettings-based DBs can/should be used initially, and that Couchbase DBs can always be swapped into place later on. The coder still needs to know the libcouchbase api and how couchbase-views work [in order to model the QSettings-DB interactions after it]. QSettings is just easier/faster, and not all applications are going to scale (initially, right away, "fast enough") enough to warrant integration with couchbase before their initial release. I'd almost go so far as to argue that no applications warrant couchbase integrations on their initial release, because it can always be integrated on an as-needed basis later (ultimately ideally ofc: AutoDb feature of Rpc Generator would set up couchbase interactions for us xD).
