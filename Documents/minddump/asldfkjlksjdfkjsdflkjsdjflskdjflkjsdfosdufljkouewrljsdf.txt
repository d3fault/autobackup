Music, as with various other schools of thought (excluding things like Medicine), if taught or learned in some formal manner, is equivalent to the spoiling of a good movie/book (STORY). I don't mind re-inventing the wheel here and there and perhaps re-learning some few thousand year old strategy or algorithm or whatever (so long as there is no danger to life involved). If I truly am indefinite, there's plenty of time to kill and learning something for yourself gives you the opportunity to see things that the original thinkers may not have. Generally, if knowledge is spoon fed to you, your brain isn't actively searching (or even able to be actively searching) for those variations/derivatives/tangents. So I will delude myself (or just plain ignorant) on a subject currently passing through my brain, thinking that I'm the first human [in this instance] to have stumbled upon it... when in fact my disassociation with mainstream media and information could be the real reason I'm learning some technique thousands of years old. Music, Logic, and others, are best learned first hand.
