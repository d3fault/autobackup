if all I do is stare at my desktop background without taking input, I am _BOUND_ to make output at some point. it might take minutes before I am able to output, but it has definite results. guaranteed results. I will not stare at my desktop indefinitely. I will think of something and write something down. Especially with music, but not if it comes from a 3rd party. Regardless of whether it is LGPL or Proprietary, it can contain brainwash. Therefore, only previously listened to music can/should be listened to and of course your own that you create. One one hand, this keeps output pure. On the other, it keeps you from "collaborating" with humanity/society/the-rest as a whole. You will become stupid because studies have shown that the collaborative whole is an order of magnitude smarter than the average person. Not as a whole, but compared to the middle guy. The "average" guy. Not the genuis.
