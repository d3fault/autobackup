A (had:The) reason there's so much stupidity is because ideas do not easily serialize from thoughts into words. The process is not lossless (except for certain areas of knowledge (one being programming :-P)): how the receiver interprets those words (deserializes them back into thoughts) varies wildly from human to human. As an aside, this also has the benefit of a stupid person being able to unknowningly/accidentally feeding an intelligent person a good idea.


OT: I hope I can always look back and say "I was stupid then", because when I can't, that means I am stupid now.
