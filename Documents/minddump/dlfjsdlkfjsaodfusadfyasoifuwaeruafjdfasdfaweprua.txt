let me down gently
i have a mental barrier i'd like to defeat
you are it
i just want to say i FUCKING LOVE YOU
i don't expect a relationship or anything at all
i just want to spend my life with you
cousin

a mental barrier while contemplating multiple universes
those multiple universes are my future
a future of drugs, sex, lust, idgaf
or of drugs, love, and goodwill
the drugs cannot be ruled out
if she made me choose drugs vs. her, i'd choose drugs solely because she made me choose
not solely... but eh, it's the stronger argument of the two. the other being I FUCKING LOVE DRUGS
i backspaced that and wrote it again in lowercase
then rewrote it because i don't like lying/modifying
i need to be myself
i don't want to act
she probably wouldn't even like me, once she got to know me
i'm 'too much' for a lot of people
she seems innocent
