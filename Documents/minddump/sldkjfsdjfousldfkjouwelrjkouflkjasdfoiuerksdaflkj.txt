Cryonics: The world you will wake up to will be better than the "heaven"/etc that the bible/etc describes. I know this to be true because I know I can/will make it so (I'll likely just lay the groundwork: I have to be frozen as well (but if it isn't so when I wake up, I will make it so THEN (but yea I should do as much as I can NOW before I am frozen (stop procrastinating you twat)))). Fucking gold streets, zzzz. Rare metals aren't rare if they're everywhere. Robots and music and drugs and bliss... I'll take that any day over worshipping god all day every day and fucking shiny metal and bullshit. "Treasures" sounds retarded if it isn't defined. What is this a fucking pirate ship story? How are people so stupid?
