Having a friend, or multiple friends, store half of your password(s) in their brain... as a measure to safeguard against your accidentally divulging a password......... makes your friend indirectly an extension of you. As in, your actions in the world now can have an influence on them (even more). Say you're politically motivated and an enemy wants to get to you. That enemy would have no problems with killing all of your friends for the sole reason of leaving you broke (unable to access your wallets).

Muchlike that old doc I wrote about "don't tell me your secrets"... the friend takes on all of your problems as well.
