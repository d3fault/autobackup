Julius Caesar circumstance

Julius Caesar was perhaps the last/only person to have his micro/macro "forge" logic COINCIDENTALLY aligned. That is the best way for a human to utilize his own life. When his micro actions are in line with macro infinite multiverse theory [and he doesn't even know it (THOUGH HE CAN KNOW IT WITHOUT ANY 'PENALTY' -- just saying he doesn't need to)]. It is why he made it so far and also why he was struck down in this universe. He lived on in others, that is for sure. Brutus simply did not exist. In his place was (now this is funny): a braver (so he died in earlier battle) or a more cowardice (so he did not attempt assassination) human being (who may or may not have had the name Brutus).

Caesar was not "good" so I do find it hard to believe that he would have helped educate his surrounding world so fast that they'd discover the medicinal cure to aging and he could live indefinently (as I wish), but I also find our very existence/life hard to believe as well. Infinite multiverse theory kicks in: since Caesar COULD (it is possible within laws of physics), he PROBABLY did at least once.

Hmm just found a huge contradiction in my own logic:
Just because anything can PROBABLY happen does not mean that it has [yet]. Otherwise we do not in fact have free will and we never do create ever.


It is a baffling thought:
Infinite previous time means EVERYTHING HAPPENED ALREADY
Infinite things to do means IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING TO HAVE ALREADY HAPPENED


Whoa--- my mind just exploded.
