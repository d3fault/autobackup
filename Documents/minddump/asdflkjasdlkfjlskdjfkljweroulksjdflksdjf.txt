Reality is retarded. That's not to say reality in the ultimate/absolute sense is retarded, only that reality here/now is. I will make the best of it and shut all the retardation out of my life (fighting an infinite stream of stupid, is itself stupid (had:no sense in fighting an infinite stream of stupid)), creating a [tiny] bubble of intelligence/sanity.
