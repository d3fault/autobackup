I am 100% sure we are one. We all grew from/out-of that which we still depend on. We are disconnected in a sense (consciousness, and we don't have like roots going into the ground etc (but that's a bad example because even trees are disconnected heh)), but still entirely dependent.

People say "we are one" with such.. doubt. I used to too. Now I am sure of it. It doesn't make sense for us not to be one.



Ok there might be multiple other "ones" that we can't see or know exist... but I mean all us earthlings and everything in the (our?) [known] universe makes up "one".
