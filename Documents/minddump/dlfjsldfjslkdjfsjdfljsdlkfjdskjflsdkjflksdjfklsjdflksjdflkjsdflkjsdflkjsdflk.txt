We live in a sugar-coated reality. I like sugar more than the next guy, but the lack of variety is making me sick to my stomach. Instead of senselessly bitching about the lack of variety being given to me, I'll do the rational thing and create some. I'm targetting a niche audience, the /b/tard ("we reject your reality and substitute our own").

Book, movies, music, games, websites... basically all forms of media (that's not to say there aren't other artists out there like me, just too few). Even the "dark" genres of media have a synthetic feel to them: "let's be dark because dark is cool". No gore/horror/action film has ever come close to what I've seen on the net.
