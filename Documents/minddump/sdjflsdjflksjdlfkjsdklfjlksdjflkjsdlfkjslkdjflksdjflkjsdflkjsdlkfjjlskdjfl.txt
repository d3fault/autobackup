Considering renouncing again, which sucks because since I don't want it to be "on a whim" means I'd delay to think it through.
My new bullet point is: The government of the USA in 2015 _rewards_ sociopathic behavior.
A previous bullet point that has been on my mind but I've yet to write: USA has declared evolution illegal. Evolution is the emergence and expansion of consciousness. Drugs [can] expand consciousness. USA is afraid of the drugs and declares them illegal (I'm hypocritical about whether or not they should be legal (legal for me and other intelligent beings, illegal for stoopidz)), and is therefore rejecting evolution. Doesn't that warrant my rejection of the-system (had:it (had:them))?


christians/good -> politics
Just as christians are good (and sadly stupid), there are plenty of politically active people in the USA that are also good (but unintentionaly delegate power to evil sociopaths). It sucks: I want to be on the side of the "good", but I also want to reject stupidity. wat do?
