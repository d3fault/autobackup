Programming is [just] organizing ones and zeros, but/and so is music. Stepping back and seeing programming as nothing more than organizing ones and zeros makes me think it's kind of silly/stupid, BUT now that I realize music is too... the pointless act of organizing ones and zeros (in both cases: programming now borrowing from music) is completely justified(?).
