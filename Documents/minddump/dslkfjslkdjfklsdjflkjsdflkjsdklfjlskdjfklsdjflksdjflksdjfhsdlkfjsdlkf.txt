No matter which direction you are headed, you are headed towards death.


Foreach vector frame, we ask ourselves "How does this [new information learned during the past vector frame] apply?". It's that subconscious asking (we don't know we are asking it, we (had:probably) don't even know how to speak at that point) that brings about intelligence. The events we perceive are chaotic. Eating is instinctive, so we [probably] think little about that [at first]. It's when we see our peers, especially our 'relatives', themselves BEING eaten, that our "how does this apply to us?" questioning finally has some worthwhile kindling information. Eventually we can relate to the fact that we are the same as our peers, which means we too will be eaten (or at least 'die of natural causes', a thing also witnessed). The brain does not emerge for intelligence, the brain emerges because it is a tactical advantage against our prey (at first only slight. arguably [un-]intelligent). Intelligence comes later. There was a huge point to this paragraph that I've forgot since thinking it up. Something related to the fear of death.
