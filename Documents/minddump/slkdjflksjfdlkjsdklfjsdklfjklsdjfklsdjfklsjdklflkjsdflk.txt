lollife: right as I press the enter key to start up the first process in this 'video launch system' (hottee/vid cap saver), my mom opens the door. had my openbsd shirt on and everything. what now?

you know what, i don't need to tat mah dih right away, i can do that later on after my parents go to sleep.

'launch from home' is much different than 'launch in apt/etc alone', but tbh it's not as bad as i thought it'd be. before i published the password/site/book/etc the other day i was thinking about how i was 'afraid of the awkwardness' from a launch at home. yea it's definitely awkward (and will probably get even more awkward), but who gives a shit. it's like water up to my heals when i anticipated it'd be water up to my neck. i feel so fucking relaxed... almost too relaxed... (i want[ed] it to be leik dis: CODE MODE ENGAGE!!!! (AND THEN LIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE IN CAPS LOCK))
