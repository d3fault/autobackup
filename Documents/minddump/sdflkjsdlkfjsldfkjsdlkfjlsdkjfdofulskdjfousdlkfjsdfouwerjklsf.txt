I feel great lately. If I had the opportunity to switch bodies/lives with anybody since the beginning of time or alive today, I wouldn't (future people will have it pretty awesome though).

To see myself as nothing more than a sex addicted/programmed machine helps me control myself. I feel like a marble on a piece of paper and you pick up two corners of it and create a little bit of slope for the marble to roll down. Lift one side more than the other and you can make the marble turn. Whereas before, I was INSIDE the marble and trying to move it by running like a hamster (those few weeks where I was passionately programming were still something though). When you view yourself as human, you feel emotionally attached to your impulses and everything you do. You are inside yourself first person and you feel special. When you understand that you're just a machine, it becomes easier to steer your will. I don't feel as though I'm working nearly as hard as those few weeks I was programming passionately (and definitely not enjoying my work as much), but I do feel I'm working an order of magnitude more than before those few weeks (greater than before the few weeks, but less than during the few weeks). Now to get myself in a mode where I am passionately rolling that marble. That would be swell.
