Re: tones
"Life is a trip" has two meanings, depending on the tone. 1 = "Life is a weird experience and it will take you lots of places and it is interesting and you will learn lots as you grow old". 2 = "Life is literally just a [psychedellic] drug trip. You are a figment/CVE inside your own brain that is tripping balls".

I still think I'm going to come out of my mom's vagina and start the process all over again when I hit dat DMT for the first time ever... but interestingly I also believe that the infinity+1'th instance of myself will break the cycle (all cycles always eventually get broken, if there are infinite of them) and will resume life 10 minutes later.
