Food is our sole dependency on society. We can attain food naturally and for free in "the wilderness", but that consists of farming... which has a decent amount of work behind it and you are better of doing it for multiple people than just yourself. People calculate that staying in society and getting a job [to earn money [to buy food]] is easier, or more worth their time, than being an independent farmer. They may or may not be wrong, depending on the job. Obvioulsy rich fucks are not wrong... but the people they employ (take advantage of) are. Mathematically speaking that has to be true (but with how many of the employees? It has to be some averaging calculation or something I'm not sure).
