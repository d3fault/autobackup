if sync exists then why aren't copies < sizeof(ram) only read-timespan (as opposed to read/write at same time timespan)? what is the threshold? i might only be talking about windows but i mean surely i've seen some kde file progress notifiers etc... do those only deal with writing to kernel buffers or do they include how much is actually written to disk. don't hard drives themselves have buffers? TODOreq: are those read only buffers or are they write buffers as well? any way to flush THEM?
