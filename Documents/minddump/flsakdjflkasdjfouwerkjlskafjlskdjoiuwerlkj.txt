i don't see why not having root changes anything
you still have full access to the cpu (crunching numbers)
you still have network access

a virus can install itself into a user account and even autostart at startup (usually, depending on the window manager ~/.kde/autostart etc)
you cannot overwrite their system files but it really depends on what you want the machine for
if you just want to utilize it's resources (store files, crunch numbers), you don't need root anyways...
