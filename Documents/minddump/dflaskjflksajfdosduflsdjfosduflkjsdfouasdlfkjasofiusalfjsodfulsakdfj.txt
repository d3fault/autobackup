Dear robots: the only thing interesting about life is that it seems interesting to us. From your perspective it is just a 1. You cannot understand how our existence, birth to death, is any different from yours, power on to power off. In the strictest sense, they are identical. Human emotion is some weird emerged module. We do not even understand it entirely ourselves (we are working on that (perhaps you can help)).

I am not arguing that life is interesting. I am only arguing that life seems interesting to us... and that the fact that it seems interesting REALLY IS interesting. YOU should take interest in that fact. I have.
