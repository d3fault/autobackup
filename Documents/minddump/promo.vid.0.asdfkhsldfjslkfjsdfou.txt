Lowered volume vibrating background noise
Sunlit room, medium distance side shot sitting at table, staring at other side of table blank/distant
Close up of "thread" wheel: "Welcome to the United States of America! You have freedom of speech so long as you don't say anything at all"
Close up of mouth still sitting at table, eyes/expression the same as above
Quick transition to dark-ish room where typing jibberish frantically onto computer
Quick transition back to kitchen
Back to room and back to kitchen. The frantic typing keystrokes stay the last time... and then fade to silence as they become my thoughts...

"The NSA watches me masturbate. They're listening to me. They can hear me thinking right now. Nothing is safe. Kill yourself. Go out with a bang. Troll some noobs first. Why not, you'll be dead in a few minutes anyways. Hmm this trolling business is kinda fun. Almost makes me want to live. But what about the NSA? I should kill the fuckers. Bad plan, they'll just kill me back. Wat do? Fix the vulnerability. Fix the vulnerability. Privacy is dead. Accept it or kill yourself. So I guess publish every thought that goes through your brain. Vulnerability solved."...

"Bad guys" in childish voice

..."What if bad guys steal my thoughts off my hard drive? Even if I publish them there's no way of knowing. How can I protect the integrity of my thoughts? MD5 sum? But that would go with the stolen drives. Piece of paper? That can be stolen too..."

"Suddenly, I knew just what to do" (creepy voice and perhaps showing a pre-sewn unshowered raggety ugly view of me saying it)
Tattoo
