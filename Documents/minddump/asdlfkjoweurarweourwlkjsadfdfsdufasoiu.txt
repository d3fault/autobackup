There seems to be the assumption that 100% of what is out there can be 100% known by the science community. Religious nuts like to pull from this assumption a basis of dismissal for the scientific method (and/or evolution as a whole). This is anything but true. Science doesn't prove anything. Scientists just form theories wherever they make sense based on observation. 100% knowledge is 100% not unattainable by the human species (unless we manage to escape our dimension? i don't believe that it's possible), so to demand it as proof of a lack of a god is dumb. so is this sentence man i am so high fuck this shit i don't want to think about God anymore.
