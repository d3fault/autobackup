the future scares me
not just me
but in any person
for every person
the level of paranoia will raise a thousand fold
personal privacy is a joke
i might as well make this all public now
should i censor (READ: SHRRRREEEEDDDDD) it?
i definitely don't trust encryption [long term]
i definitely don't trust networks [ever]
i don't trust any other human
wat do?
