IMT: incapable of sharing proof
Ethics aside (referring to previous doc), it's a physical impossibility to share reasonable proof with the majority of multiverses. In fact, since it isn't even 100% provable, the closer you get to 100% proof, the less multiverses you can share the proof with!

99/100 death machine (btw I think getting a friend/peer to do the "random number generation" for you might solve the PRNG problem, but idfk and probably never will) = 99 universes now don't get to see the proof!

Therefore, you most likely live in a universe where it hasn't been proven.

That you have proof and that you weren't the one to "make" it is ridiculously improbable... but still possible.

To take control and utilize will and to test it yourself is... err I'm not sure it's accurate to say, but... more likely? Or perhaps I mean "equally as likely but since you DIE in all the other universes where your peers simply 'lack proof', it appears '100%' (or near) to the remaining instances"? Man this shit hurts my head to think about...
