it's been very rewarding typing this morning... even though i'm not sure if i got anywhere with my code
i'm still glad i got these documents out
it feels good to output
really good.
i think i starve myself of it
it makes what comes out primo shit however...
that makes no sense from what you're saying with this app
you want to DOCUMENT EVERYTHING
but mainly only because you don't want to have to worry about 'turning the recording on' when you are going to type something that just popped into your head
you seriously just lost 2 really good thoughts because of titles being typed in FML.
