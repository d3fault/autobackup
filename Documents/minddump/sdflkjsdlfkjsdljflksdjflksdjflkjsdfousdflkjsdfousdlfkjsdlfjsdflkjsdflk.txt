Psychology is the economics of the mind. The word most frequently used in both of them (as in, it's a word used in both of them.. and the most frequent of such list of shared words) is "incentive".


I refuse to pollute my mind with non-deriveable information. I will fucking kill myself (but you first) if I'm forced to process it. The government needs to (and will) adapt/adjust to me/us (they tend to have business relationships that end up forcing citizens to deal with those businesses).
