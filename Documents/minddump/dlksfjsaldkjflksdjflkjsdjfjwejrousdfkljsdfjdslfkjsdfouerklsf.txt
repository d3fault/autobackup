Should I or should I not attempt to build "normalcy" [whether directly with the government or just as a matter of free will]? I suppose right now I'm only wondering whether or not to attempt to do it with my peers (government). I am pessimistic (though rightfully so?) that my peers won't listen to reason and that I'll waste far too much time pursuaying them (or at least attempting to). People can lead you on and waste your time easily, and will. It is especially prominent in the halls of office. Most politicians love it though, a chance to stall while looking like they're doing something.

Back to the original thought: such pessimism is deserved to be ignored at least in the matter of "let's light a match and see if anything is flamable" level of ease of changing (had:turning) the government. Normalcy is such an awesome idea that it deserves your mom.

Err I fucked the first sentence of above paragraph: the pessimism is to be ignored at least temporarily to check to see if pursuasian on the subject proves successful with an acceptable amount of time invested.
