Had the best day/5meo-trip of my life and have never felt more alive etc etc. So much went through my brain and I barely spoke any of it or remember any of it. Also got pretty mad (as usual) that the recorder wasn't on when i pulled it out of my pocket (my fault, didn't hit "hold").... so I jumped into the air and smashed it into the ground as hard as I could (felt right at the time but regret it now lmfao). It didn't ruin my day or my mood. The thoughts themselves were worth it... too bad I can't remember much of them. I stood up and understood the world around me (like that computer time, except the whole world/universe this time) and saw Hannah and knew what she was. Tons of metaphors of course and I have no idea if they ACTUALLY mean anything, but I like to think they do. I know I say this every time but this trip was special. I have never "defeated" my fears (by accepting death/life and understanding/acknowledging that I'm still alive... etc... or something) like this time. I'm sad that it wasn't recorded but fuck it. Was my favorite 10 minutes alive so far. I feel as though I branched off of the repeating/recurring multiverse, however I admit that I may say/think that every single time (and am ok with THAT too).
