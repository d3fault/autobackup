Would I say that my use of copyleft is philosophical? Maybe yes... but it's more accurate to say it's a matter of sanity. To say it's philosophical could be misinterpretted because there's many aspects and gray areas of philosophy. Sanity is, for the most part, black and white. I won't allow non sharable information to enter my brain because it will make me insane. I won't allow you to make my information non sharable because fuck you (you would be contributing to global insanity (the state we are already in (and the state ANY evolved-from-bleh(tempted to write 'nothing' instead of 'bleh', but surely it wasn't nothing!) species is in by default))).

tl;dr: eat->greed->profit->insanity

It's true that it's more profitable to make your information 'not sharable unless you get moneys'. Earth 2014's economy is 'driven' by blind chaotic greed (aka 'the free market'). I [now] highly doubt there's an illuminati (unless of course they're just dumb profit-driven illuminati -_-), because we'd probably be better off if there was (someone actually 'driving').
