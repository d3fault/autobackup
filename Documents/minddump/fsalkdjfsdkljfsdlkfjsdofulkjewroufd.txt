I've got the world by the balls. Do I squeeze or do I make them feel good? Do I live in the moment and do what feels/is right? Those are two different respective rights.

I mean, somewhere in between squeezing them and making them feel good, varying moment to moment at my own will?
Err to the side of "is right" than "feels right".
