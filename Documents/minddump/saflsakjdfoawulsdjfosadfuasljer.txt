authenticity/verification is still VERY FUCKING HANDY for author verification and bit rot detection
so fuck storing shit decryptedly (sans book. fuck yea hardcopies are so fucking secure)

god damn i hate bit rot
scares the shit out of me

all the more reasons to launch + minddump

i can't wait for the ecstacy

peace of mind

etc

shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit

my brain's going to be high 24/7

i might not even need drugs

(but i'll probably still opt for them hah)


maybe i'll just be the most open motherfucker ever (for now)

idfk

meh that's not an accomplishment
i definitely will be in the now

but i'll probably be mimicked shit tons in the future

i mean

we are all mimicking

i mimick my parents
grandparents
and peers

but i will be all of the above given time
so....


whoop de fucking do


i don't know
i don't know
i don't know

I DON'T FUCKING KNOW

what to do anymore


i mean

i know to launch
that's fucking given
i can't wait for the sanity

the ecstacy overload

purity
truthiness
open
freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

whatever you want to call it
