Subconscience is me hacking into myself from different universe/dimension/etc. I devote my forelobe to understanding/hacking my environment and after thousands/billions/whatever years of it, I'm able to send output/signals to other universes/dimensions. The only way my signals can arive in alternate universes it through another instance's subconscience... for some technical (or ability) limitation. I am slowly building myself up and making myself smarter and smarter earlier and earlier.

Not sure any truth to this theory because I think all intelligence goes poof at the big collapse. Still an entertaining/mb-possible theory...
