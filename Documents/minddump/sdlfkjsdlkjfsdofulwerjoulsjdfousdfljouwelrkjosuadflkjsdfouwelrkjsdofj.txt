Maybe regular DMT is the recursive drug. I take DMT and then am born again in the trip. I grow up, live the same life, take DMT again... then it repeats.

I guess there's a way of testing that theory.......... BUT HOWEVER no way of knowing if it's true, if it is true. Can only find out that it's false.

Should I never do it, then?

...Or should I keep on doing it because it's the key to immortality?
