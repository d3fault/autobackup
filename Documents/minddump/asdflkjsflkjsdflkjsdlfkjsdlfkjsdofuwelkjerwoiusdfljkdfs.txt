Technically I am selling out right now because I am acting. I am restraining my movements (I feel compelled to dance!) and my speech (I feel compelled to speak, but also to sing [some]!). My 'selling out' (or what I thought it would be up until this moment) will be me being myself, finally. So it's hard for me to analyze what made me think of it backwards all this time. Was it brainwash or sheer stupidity? If brainwash, was it accidental or intentional? Is that the true consiracy of the illuminati and/or media? Or was it a consequence of chaos spitting out a 'free market'?
