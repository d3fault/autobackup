Just like I could lead a government, I could lead a revolution.
Tangents:
They always get shot.
The only difference between a revolutionary and a successful politician is that a successful politician writes down his stuff and [supposedly] has majority consensus for his being there and his writings valid. The funniest part of that system is that it later refers to its own writings as a source of validity. Majority consensus(right word?) arbitrary legal/illegal divides.


Ok so funny story bro: some monkeys wander out of a jungle and then write on a piece of paper: "this paper is valid". Later, when trying to determine whether or not an entire system based on that piece of paper being valid is itself valid (of which the piece of paper is just a module (can burn it and make it again or modify it even)), they refer to that same piece of paper as a means of proof that the entire system is valid.

This is both stupid and smart. By the time they realize the error, they realize that there are more important questions such as "where the fuck did we come from?" and are long since conscious (&& self-aware && and as-intelligent-as-an-average-human-in-2014).
