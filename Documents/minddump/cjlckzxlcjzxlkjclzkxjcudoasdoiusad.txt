i was trying to plug my AUX cable into my phone and the phone was upside down and i had no idea why the AUX cable wouldn't go in (^^^) and yea i eventually probed to see that it was upside down which is when i came up with the above gem. gem should be a tag btw. you can go back and read shit and call it a gem.
