Asterisk

Instead of carving d3fault on my forehead and putting ink in it for a home-made tattoo at/during launch, it could/would be better (and more generic and ... copy'able (trendstarting)) to just do a fucking asterisk. It signifies the wildcard in programming... and to put it directly over my brain is to say...... my brain is capable of anything. It's cute and doesn't matter which one I do lol
