How is it that there is both infinite creativity but also infinite time for all creativity to repeat itself infinite times?

The answer:
There is infinite time and infinite creativity, yes. We are and always will be on the very first iteration of infinite creativity. Just because the repeats haven't come yet, doesn't mean they won't after the very first (*cough*infinite*cough) iteration of every permutation of every variation of some creative form (tempted to put "expression"). We are all creative even if we have strictly mathematical minds. We are creative because we are created. We are created out of a fucking shit ton of atoms coming together and using the laws of physics to form a system within said cluster of atoms. Incidentally, the cluster of atoms became conscious and fucked his mum.

Ok more back to the point: the system itself, whether it realizes it (or even can realize it) or not, is complex to a degree unfathomable (yet?) to most (all?) human beings. It is therefore creative by our own definition. It is creative by it's own definition. The moment your dad's jizz connects with your mom's egg, you are already several orders of magnitude more complex than everything I have on my hard drive(s), which is like 75gb or so.
