I have trouble expressing myself, and I finally know why (I've known why for a while (and have probably written it in various places), but I still want to write it now in a compact and precise form): 

1) Free form speech (not afixed to a medium) is not copyrighted
2) The NSA can warrantlessly wiretap anybody and everybody
3) The corporations (of which Hollywood is a sect) own the goverment (and therefore, the NSA)

Result of 1 + 2 + 3: I limit severely the things that I say to my friends and family. I don't want my genius (Whether I actually am one or not is irrelevant. That I think I am is all that matters) to be taken, copyrighted, and then NO LONGER SHARE-ABLE BY EVEN ME. Sure I made it/something up and I know I made it up, but since it isn't recorded I can't prove that to anyone.

re: NSA -- Though I do believe the above can and probably is happening, they are not entirely evil. They protect us from terrorists ALSO. In their spare time (and for bribes (or because of threats to their lives (etc)), they spy on people who talk to themselves and say the darndest things.
