my offline setup could easily be modified *without* leaving physical keylogger
the bios could be keylogged, and could be re-programmed to output a different inaudible (but maybe audible to dogs?) tone for each keystroke that my phone could then pick up
the bios could also just save the logged keys to it's own memory.. for later retrieval. but the above demonstrates realtime logging.
