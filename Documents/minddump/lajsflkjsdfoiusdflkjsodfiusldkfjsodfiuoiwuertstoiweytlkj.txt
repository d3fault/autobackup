what do i want?
i want to be able to answer the question: "what do i want?"

at the very least it is a very difficult and timeless question.... but i am unsure if it has an answer or not.
it's personal... but when a being arrives at the state of mind that i am at, there tends to not be an answer to it.

i want a lot of things that contradict each other. i want a normal life with no attention and a wife and kids and all that bullshit (but still turn key retirement of course).... but i also still want to live full blast (which has a price of attention) and etc and shit because life is short and precious and it makes the best of it. it's like mood swings of sorts except i go from one fantasy to the next instead of just "happy" to "depressed" (though yea, i do feel depressed from time to time too)

i guess i'm launching
i mean
fuck

there is no perfect life
and i keep trying to find it and plan it
i am wasting all of my life trying to make my life perfect (in the planning sense)
i'm glad i'm 24... but meh.
