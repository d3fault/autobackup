Politics is not a source of the problem; politics is a product of the problem. The problem is human nature: it's a 'dog eat dog' (human eat human) world. Survival of the fittest.

Politics does, however, make fixing the problem that much harder. It creates a very real, yet still arbitrary, power that is used to (ba dum tss) keep hold of that power.


Evolution brought us here, not evil snickering men with brains the size of planets (that gives them 20/20 foresight). It's all about the bootstrap theory. We need to bootstrap from where we are to somewhere better. [Modern] Politics is in the way, successfully relying on itself to keep itself afloat.

Power rarely ever surrenders itself, so I doubt the current government infrastructure could transition.

"But you really just need the people.. they're the real government" <- This is revolution talk and will get you killed/imprisoned-indefinitely for treason, that's why I didn't say it. Someone else said it and I am just quoting them. Yea, that guy.
^And besides, hivemind won't work yet because of another aspect of human nature: TOO MANY STUPID PEOPLE (I am probably one of them).


The overwhelming vast majority of species that evolve never make it past the monkey+1 (or monkey equivalent) stage of evolution. Resource exhaustion and worldwide cannibalism, here we come.
