Re: 6 bullets in an revolvar. The opposite holds true too, bitch. Train of thought: There's a security light attached to our house that keeps turning on randomly. Shit is broken or something but an electrician replaced it's bulbs recently so I only really noticed it coming on at random intervals the past month or so. Tried to fix it a few times and the even 'fantacized' about hitting the bulbs with a metal baseball bat: FIXED! But that's a bad idea because the electricity could travel through the bat and through my hands. There's no way I could swing fast enough for that not to happen (although my momentum will probably keep me from "holding it there" for like 10+ seconds, ya know?). The security light being off first would definitely help, but this is where it starts to get interesting. The fact that it turns on at 'random' intervals means I can't guarantee that it won't turn on right "as" (or 'just before') the baseball bat hits the bulb. So extrapolating from that, everything you do: you die. Since I am not dead right now, there's gotta be some interesting observation that can be pulled from the 6 bullets + opposite. Why are we all here and in our present forms? Bleh. In the end I just put electric tape over the sensor so hopefully that'll make it never trigger. The implications pertaining to the fact that the opposite must also hold true is what really interests me. I had never thought of that until last night.
