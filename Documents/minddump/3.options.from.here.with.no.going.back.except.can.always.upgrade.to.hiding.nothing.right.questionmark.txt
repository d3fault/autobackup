options
-hide nothing
-hide everything
-hide something, which has same paranoia factors as hiding everyting (and so gains me nothing from hiding everything... except maybe a longer life?)


i'd love to hide nothing and live longest*

longest is a retarded statement
it's like 100% efficiency
or 'perfect'
unattainable by definition

unless i reach success
which, i'll admit, isn't likely at all

well i like that i've gotten it down to 3 choices
i don't think there are any others

actually,, booleanily... there aren't. there can't be because i've covered:
0
1
and everything in between.

so shit.
it's that easy

nothing, everything, something(s)

infinite combinations of outcomes for each.
no wrong answer
