Expecting my launch to be perfect (life shaper wise) is like expecting evolution to be perfect. I've very likely made "mistakes"... but I'm trying to retain as much accuracy as possible. There is truth in "mistakes" that, in a different way, rebalances things. I've tried to document my journey to [???? (that's right, I had no clue where I was going or what I was doing (but now I do))] the best I can. It would be a shame/waste/tragedy if I deleted/censored/LIFE-SHAPED most of it away. A politician would.
