off to debian land. i don't like how fedora 17 takes so damn long to shutdown and i dislike kde in general. trying xfce but might revert to LXDE if i don't like it (i'll be able to tell by the time i have all the shit installed). i'm going to ditch my timestamps for every file, including the ones in this commit. dir.structure.txt will be my most up to date timestamping snapshot of every file (including this one) in this commit. someone will probably have to extract this after i'm dead but MAYBE it will be me lol
