ad-double
addubs
whatever i end up calling it
"$1 first day (for the whole day) doubling until they refuse to pay for the next day"

VS./and

adcaptcha
normal ad usage but with a captcha embedded in the same image

no reason i can't combine these two
though i dunno if i should limit both of them

they are both good ideas on their own
i would be limitting both of them by exclusively tying each to each other
but at the same time, might as well let them interoperate


adcaptcha needs standalone/regular advertising mode
but SHOULD have "doubles" mode

"doubles" advertising should also have adcaptcha?

vice versa
which domain should i go with? or neither?

"<buzzword> advertising"
or both? pointing to <buzzword>
idgaf

but there are DEFINITELY uses where i _DONT_ want to use captchas and i still want to present ads

statichan
static-chan
and deletion mirror

though static-chan will use adcaptcha for submitting/replying, ofc
