I saw myself for the first time ever while taking a shit just now. Sitting there with my shirt pulled over my head and my fists jammed into my eye sockets, I started to hallucinate a bit (nothing out of the usual here). I saw a ball of electricity. It had lots of electrical lightning-ish bendy beams coming from it, sort of like one of those glass ball things you put your hands on and the electricity goes to your hands... except waaaaay more electical beams, and at the center was a solid ball of a bunch of those same beams but way more compact (instead of some plastic thingo generating electricity like in the glass ball). It was rotating at the same time as the bendy electrical beams were sporatically attaching/detaching from it in various places. The bendy electrical beams were both supporting it, and it. It is (tempted to write 'was', but it's still there ('was' still kind of fits because I don't see it now)) a while true loop after a few billion years of evolution. Before today, I generally visaulized (forcibly, whereas this one appeared subconsciously) the while true loop as being a single and thin beam of electricity in an oval/circle. I GUESS IT'S NOT ALL WRONG, since everything in the universe is connected/one... but still what I saw just now was much larger and folded onto itself tons like a ball of rubber bands. I am it, I am that ball of electricity chemically suspended in a 'brain' (even if not totally physically accurate, it's definitely metaphorically/logically (like object-oriented programming) accurate). The rest of my body parts are just growths/extensions/modules; they are mostly optional (but they do make things interesting :-P). Penis.
