If someone were to ask me if I made "Music Fingers", I wouldn't know how to respond. Yes I made some of it, but I used a ton of other shit I'm not responsible for: MusicFingers(qt(gnu(linux)) <--> arduino). "If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe" (Sagan). So eh leik yea I made SOME PARTS of Music Fingers "from scratch", but err idk I don't know how I should respond to it. Maybe I'll just quote Sagan.

lol @ the 2x "idk" in a row
