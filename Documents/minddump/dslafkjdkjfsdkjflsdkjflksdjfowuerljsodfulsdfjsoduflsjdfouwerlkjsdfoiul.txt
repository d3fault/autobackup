This launch is sloppy, but so is evolution.

I'm afraid, ashamed, and embarrassed... but I'm going on ahead. I am striving for scientific accuracy. Who cares if it makes me look "bad" (bad being subjective as fuck -- not the TRUE bad). A lot of animals died painful deaths for life to have gotten where it is today.
