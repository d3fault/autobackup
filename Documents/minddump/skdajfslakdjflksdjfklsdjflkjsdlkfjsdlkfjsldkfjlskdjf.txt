Every pessimist thinks they're a realist, and [something similar but MAYBE with the other 2 categories (optimist/realist) and what they think they are (or maybe how they see the pessimist/other-2) -- I had it yesterday but forget now].


For example, "and every pessimist sees the realist as an optimist" would fit/make-sense... but I'm not sure that was the original thought.

Edit: I think it was "and every pessimist sees the realist as an optimist" (as in, overly optimistic). Hey,my guess/example was right (might be wrong)
