People, such as Maddox, say that adding "in my opinion" is redundant. If I were to say "People who don't do cryonics are unintelligent", it might be interpretted as a statement of fact. Adding "in my opinion" makes it clear that it is only my opinion (I might be wrong, and others have different opinions). Using "imo" makes the realm of factual statements (math, logic, codan, etcz) easier to differentiate from the realm of impulsive desire/preference (emotion, opinion, etcz).
