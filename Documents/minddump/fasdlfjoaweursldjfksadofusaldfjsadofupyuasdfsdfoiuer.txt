an OpenCL implementation of a raytracer that uses the GPU to calculate the lighting of geometry. each pixel of screen is assigned it's 3d graphical coordinates and where the light is. using this, it can calculate whether or not there is light hitting it. it also has a read-only copy of the entire map. i tried to just code it, but i don't have OpenCL installed and i doubt i could anyways. fuck it
