I am just sitting here in silence
aside from movies, this is all I do now

ok not silence
have music playing (specifically NOT last.fm radio anymore, fuckers)

but my mouth does not move

i close my eyes and meditate
until I think of something to say

this is how I will live
this is how I will FORCE MYSELF to code to launch

I'm sick of procrastinating
I'm sick of this lifestyle
so I need to force myself through it
through the difficult part

it also helps me to stay unnoticed
which I should do until launch

attracting attention might result in data loss or deletion or death

become a monk
temporarily

you should only output by typing for the time being


text documents (like this) and code

nothing else is allowed


and occassional movies

but eh, might have to cut those off too if they get to be too much

also: dexter, boardwalk empire, walking dead, family guy
all released every sunday night lol

O BTW PEEP SHOW SERIES STARTING AT THE END OF THIS MONTH FUUUUCK YEEEEEEAAAAAA so pumped

those other shows i mentioned are going to shit
but peep show never did
hope it doesn't :-)

boardwalk empire is still meh
but the rest are SHIT
dexter is garbage.

family guy is pretty much the same every time
worth watching but the humour is pretty predictable
seth mcfarlane has expended all of his knowledge

i can't wait until i'm at that point
when i'm a hack and kids are talking shit

fuck yea

out with the old, in with the new

my 'new' will be a successor of software
seth's new will just be another tv show -_- zzzzz

yes i am talking shit hello seth suck my dick plox <3

can't wait till he makes fun of me on his show but he probably won't now that i mentioned it but he probably will now that i said that except now he won't now that i said that (while(true)) _SUCK MY DICK BITCH NOW YOU ARE UNSURE WHAT TO DO_

($20 says he has to ask someone what that while(true) shit means)
