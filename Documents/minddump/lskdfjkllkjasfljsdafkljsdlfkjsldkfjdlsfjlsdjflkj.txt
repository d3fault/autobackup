A government by the people for the people, or a government by the corporations for the corporations?

Yes a corporation is made up of numerous people, but as an "entitiy" there is no single emotional/compassionate/human consciousness driving that entity; it's, as rms put it, a psychopath (I prefer the term sociopath, but w/e).

A publicly traded corporation is required by law to chase profit with complete disregard for humanity as a whole (except the few regards that laws demand of such corporations: e.g. "no littering").
