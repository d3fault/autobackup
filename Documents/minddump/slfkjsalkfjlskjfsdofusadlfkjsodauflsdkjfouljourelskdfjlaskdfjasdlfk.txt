A book title: Please Kill Me So I Can Prove Some Theory False
in place of 'some': a, my, this


Actually leaning towards "minddump 0-24: through insanity and beyond" again. It encapsulates and... admits/JUSTIFIES... more (insanity is a VITAL STEP to genius (hurr arrogance)). The transexual title isn't coming out as funny as I'd like. I want something like that 93mb of 7zip (had:youKnow) files and accidentally the whole bloba-blaba bottle. "I accidentally like transexuals" isn't capturing that for me. Some variations that I also don't like: "I accidentally the whole transexual", "I accidentally transexual", plural of previous... meh.

Well yea fuck it it's not like it matters THAT much... so probably just sticking with minddump for now... but still wanted to write down the "please kill me" variant as I still do find it hilarious.
