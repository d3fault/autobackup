kaylee crazy
kaylee denial

kaylee keeps mentioning she's crazy around me (to other people, but in my presence). i think she's referring to when i said i am mentally stable, trying to imply she's not or whatever. perhaps even saying she's into it. this is good because it shows interest. though my saying i am mentally stable would actually have been a bad thing

i said in the presence of eddie "is being a vegetarian a requirement for dating you?" and she got defensive and said it wasn't. 'the small things are what give people away'.


i can't stop thinking about her although i am much more relaxed about it. it doesn't make me feel like i need to take action (confrontation) etc.

i am currently/frequently wondering if i should shape myself to try to win her. i have yet to go public so ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. still, i lean towards being myself. if i'm wrong about her and i have shaped myself towards her, then i have wasted potential


i dunno what eddie is doing in the picture, she broke up with him once a while ago but now he's back i guess? maybe she's just using him as free/cheap labor to help with her new house (sex = payment)? who knows. i even acknowledge the possibility that she has him there just to keep me away from her... like her bodyguard of sorts (though this is unlikely)


guh was planning on doing much more elaborate writing on this topic but i swear RIGHT WHEN i turned on my computer, the door opened and someone came home. FUCK been procrastinating all day... for that very reason: predicted that right when i turned on the computer someone would come home. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK need to move out
