Our desire for free time is what stands in the way of us having free time.

I'll explain it backwards: We could all have free time if we used robots to do our maintenance tasks for us (food harvesting mainly). That's technologically feasible today. Politically, though, it's a challenge. Politicians benefit from the way things are today; they benefit tremendously from taxing the "free market". Since they define how things are, and since it benefits them to have things to stay the same, them changing the way things are is extremely unlikely. I digress: It's really the mega corporations who, through the use of lobbying/bribes/etc, control how things are (and who, by definition, benefit greatly from the way things are). A corporation is a slave to profits, which translates into: A [publicly traded] corporation is a slave to it's shareholders. Shareholders are just individuals who are trying to make money. Money is time. So, the pursuit of money/time is ultimately what's standing in the way of us all having free time.
