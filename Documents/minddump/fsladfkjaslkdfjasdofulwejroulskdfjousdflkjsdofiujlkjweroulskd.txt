Finalized logical deductions (had:thoughts instead of "logical deductions") on infinite multiverse theory:
Take 10 quarters or coins or whatever. Set goal X to be achieved if you get all 10 coin flips to be the same. If you get one coin toss wrong, you die instantly. If you do choose not to play, you live a long and dull life and never achieve goal X. Despite being ridiculously rare, infinite multiverse theory (because of infinite time) guarantees that you will get the 10 coin tosses in a row at least eventually. The key... the trick... the "harnessing"... is to choose to flip to begin with. Do not waste your life by choosing not to flip. "Sitting around alive" will not bring you pleasure.

You can and will die in many universes. I will probably die in this-
Hmmm hard to ID...
I cannot differentiate...
When I say "this" universe, it covers all the ones where I die and also all the ones where I don't!
So I will both die in this universe and not die in this universe.

Ok trying to get back on track: I can die, but it doesn't matter. What matters is that I die flipping coins: trying to achieve goal X.

Fancy theories say that your death in one universe is a dream in another (one that "branched" and continued living). It is an interesting (entertaining*) theory but there is no evidence to back it up and no reason for it. More likely, our dreams are just our subconscious communicating with us: warning us, etc. (HOW WILL THE SUBCONSCIOUS COMMUNICATE WITH US ONCE IT STARTS TO AGREE THAT HARNESSING INFINITE MULTIVERSE THEORY IS THE BEST WAY TO GO?).


This is the most accurate analysis because it does not make any theoretical logical leaps. It is all perfectly logically sound.
