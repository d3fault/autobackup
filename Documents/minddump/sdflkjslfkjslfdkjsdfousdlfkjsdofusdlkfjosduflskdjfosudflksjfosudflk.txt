Just some minimizing:


The assertion that will cost me my life if false: time is infinite.
If time is infinite, infinite multiverse theory is true.

The "significant" (famous last word, since even a large number approaches 0% of infinity) improbability that we evolved from the big bang leads us to believe that time is infinite. It does not prove it, but it is my subjective belief that it points to (had: correlates with) it being true. I am almost (had:no-'almost'-here (added it after writing the below and repeating myself)) willing to bet my life on it (*gasp*).

Additionally, time being finite does not make logical sense. What happened before time started? What happens after time ends? To even be able to answer those questions time needs to still exist, therefore time cannot logically begin or end. This is the final nail in the coffin.

Evolution being improbable brings me to 99.9999999999999999999% sure that infinite time exists, and the logical analysis that time cannot begin or end brings me to 100%...... at least 100% in the sense that I'm willing to bet my life on it (still not "proven" in the strict sense).

I am afraid but I understand that fear is naturally selected (and therefore amplified along the way) from one derivative to the next. It is unrelated to infinite multiverse theory because IMT, if true, guarantees infinite Stevens. Fear tremendously helps a deriving chain (tempted to write "web" here) of DNA to survive in a single big bang instance, but fear is not necessary for > 0 of those infinite Stevens to continue to exist when other Stevens who did not fear enough, die. Therefore, fear can be written off as unecessary paranoia (so long as you are willing to die in > 0 of them because you did not fear enough (but 100% of the infinite Stevens die anyways)).


Bring it, corrupt ass motherfucking politicians/etc.
Surely it cannot be illegal to not fear death... as we all die.
