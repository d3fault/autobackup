the video is the key thing
which i still haven't completely finalized/figured out


is also vulnerable

scalable, yet vulnerable

but the good news:

one SECOND of video is tons of bits of data
and 1 bit doubles the possible keys


so extending the video by a few seconds would probably give you a few extra hundred years...
i mean i don't know for sure i haven't done jack shit math

but i'm guessing/assuming


maybe we should just use the video itself as the only type of 'password'
nothing else

like you 'sign' something (text etc) with your 'password' (the video)

the first copy on 'the network' (d3fault) is tells you who the author is

IDFK

just randomness here
