the introverted extrovert

i'm not sure this is going to work
perhaps i'm only able to write so much because i am introverted and do not publish


at this point in time i wish to believe i'll cold turkey launch (become extroverted at the flick of a switch (the press of a button ;-))) and remain there until death...
...however maybe i'll only last a week

it will look stupid for me to peek my head out for a week and then to retract it back into shell
there will be lots of people prying at the shell from then on
annoying


but i'll do whatever i need to do
i can change my mind about anything at any point


right now i want to launch
later i might want to retract
become introverted/private again


perhaps i'll build the 'privatization' (simply software, a house design, or possibly even a sound/bullet-proof-and-self-sustaining(*)-mecha-suit) publically and then retreat into the privacy that i have created

the mecha suit had better be bunker buster + nuke proof too xD
i think it would be fun to just build one, regardless of all the 'proofs'
just as a physical enhancement suit. "i can lift 5000 lbs sup?"

obviously 'fingers' would be integrated (as would all/most other limbs :-D)




back on the subject of extrovert'ing
it is not "me"
it's not something i've ever really done before
i turn bright red when i am "on stage"
yes i can COLD TURKEY through that shit
until i BECOME comfortable
but it still isn't me [yet?]

i will it
i emote it
i want it

so it will be "me"

i just worry that i won't be able to write and think as freely as i can now
the paranoia of being jacked will have gone away, YES
but will i still be as bold if i know others are watching...? that remains unknown
sure, i'm not THAT bold... but i can definitely be... less bold...
