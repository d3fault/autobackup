I yearn for a raidproof existence. Launch (or other (freenet encrypted-only-for-now(can publish decrypt keys at launch!))) buys me that. Launch buys me sanity. Jesus christ am I still fucking HEEEEEERRRRRREEEEEEE (not as in: "not dead"... but as in: "not launched"). Zeus fucking damnit I am so fucking slow seriously Steven or whatever the fuck you want to call yourself (irrelevant): hurry the fuck up. Life is being wasted. Life is draining. Tick tock motherfucker.
