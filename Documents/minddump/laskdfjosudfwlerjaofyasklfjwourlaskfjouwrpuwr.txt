some interesting kaylee quotes

"i hate people"

"well, nothing matters" (talking about olympics. immediately after i said "they are all [every sport] just running in circles"). drew was there and saying certain sports matter and some don't. not sure if she really meant what she said haha. i'm tempted to send her a text saying: "\"nothing matters\" / except arbitrary rules about inter-cousin relationships :-P" ... but meh, i don't think i can logic her into dating me (that one bitch said it to chase in house). maybe i should say it anyways. what would i lose?


she might not have said "i hate people". maybe it was "i don't like people".. i forget. the context for that one was lost




being around her depresses me
like i've blown an opportunity (but i'm not really sure i have... there may not have ever been an opportunity to begin with...)
sure, i'm no longer wondering
but we act different around each other
i stared at her with the "oh my fucking god [you are so beautiful]" face yesterday... and she bailed in a matter of seconds
i'll probably always win that one now

she used to stare right back [and win!]
