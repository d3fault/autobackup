We live in a world that says repeating information is illegal (by default). Given that, how can anybody be sane?

I think my "I'll take stupidity over insanity" statement is going to be my best quote. I'll never top it. Put that shit on my gravestone etc. Random: I was watching Bowie's Labyrinth when I came up with it. Paused dat shit, walked into my room thinking it sounded, cool, then was teh blown away when I added the two parenthesis during the persist.
