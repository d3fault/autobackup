i don't know what's going on anymore
i might be ill
the mold in my home might be killing me
it might be depression
i might be insane

i feel like i'm going to die soon~

but i know this: i will die eventually
the time to act is now. it will only get more and more difficult as time elapses

do it for kaylee
do it for yourself
do it for caydon
do it for your mom
do it to put a name in 'the book'

do it because you can
and because you want to
and because physical/mental pleasure WILL follow
hookers and drugs at the very least
kaylee and love (plus drugs) at the very most

tangent: love is a drug
