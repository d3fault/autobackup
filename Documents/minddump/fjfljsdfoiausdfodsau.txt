it has now been about an hour since i thought of this
the ground was rocks and i were staring right at them
they eeach cast small shadows on top of each other.
i felt like i was looking at coal on the ground
they were not shaded greyy, but the shadows that were cast were 100% black.


after staring at them for quite a while,
i said that if i don't write them down then i can't watch the wire (if it's on ice yet) and i said i have to code instead. rofl.
