Facebook clone, zzz...
I do want a platform where I can communicate with my friends without giving up some of my copyrights to Mark Zuckerburger. Facebook is a piece of shit and a clone needs more to replace it (he exploited a niche market, whoop de do). Anyways back to the point: I'd want my content to be under the DPL, but I wouldn't really want to force my friends to do the same. They could be presented a slider of license choices. The default could be "All Rights Reserved" and then the publish button should be disabled ;-). Or the default could be dpl ofc.

But yea this idea is pretty much just like "info repo" (they are (or can be) one and the same), except basically I'm just looking at it from the social networking angle atm. Your friends should be able see of all the friends who would see their content for each of the license slider positions. For example, I would not allow anyone's content published < DPL (more restrictive) to... err... be shown to me. They see my picture as a gray'd (and toward the bottom (a tooltip-or-message can tell them why (what license minimum is needed)) out whatever shit. You choose cc0, and obviously every one of your friends is going to be "in color" (indicating they would see your post).

You can of course make temporary exceptions or even permanent exceptions on a friend by friend basis, yada yada there's tons of OBVIOUS combos here I'm too lazy to list
