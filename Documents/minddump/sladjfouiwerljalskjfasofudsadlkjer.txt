every time i reach a dead-end in code i just want to shoot myself in the face with my shotgun
i guess i do in alternate universes
but in this one i always think "what's the point" or "it's not worth it"
but i still want to
i want relief

but the shotgun will only bring nothingness
which also doesn't exist
nothingness can only be analyzed while alive also
there is no escape
so long as you are, there is
and has to be

i don't believe in reincarnation
so i don't know what death is
black screen, i suppose
nothingness
depressing thought

the concept is baffling
try to remember before you were born
impossible
is the same as trying to comprehend death
impossible
you aren't and you won't be
but in between is life
enjoy it
enjoy hating it
hate enjoying it
it doesn't matter what your outlook is
you can only have an (used to have 'that' instead of 'an') outlook for a limited amount of time
so you might as well mold it into a positive outlook
even if you're faking it
fake it to yourself
fake it until it's real... as they say...
no point bawwwwwing
but conversely, no point being glad you're here
you just ARE
but i am glad
weirdly enough
instinctively, i guess
none of this makes any sense
my being here makes no sense
cool story bro
