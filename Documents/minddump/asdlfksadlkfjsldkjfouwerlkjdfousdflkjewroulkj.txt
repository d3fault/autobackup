i feel pretty confident in my life because i feel pretty confident in infinite multiverse theory because i am confident in my existence, which depends on infinity to even exist.
"frozing" will probably work. it all makes "logical sense" that it will work


"logical sense"
vs.
"relative certainty"


it makes logical sense that all 6 bullets in a revolver might be duds
i am relatively certain that if i pull the trigger 6 times, at least one of them won't be a dud




i think this stuff has probably been studied before
whatever class that one dude was teaching in "red lights" is probably it


i hate that movie
they put a fictional twist on it and ripped me off
because i can control the world around me in a similar manner
except it isn't psychic bullshit nonsense
it's infinite multiverse theory at play

now i feel hacked/jacked
but then again it was just a shitty movie so it's probably just my paranoia taking over



a re-assuring thought: i can code rpc and abc from scratch right this very moment
my actual software creations have never even begun yet
so everything up to now is just the documenting of the planning phase
yes i value it and even treasure it
but the real good stuff has yet to come
and i refuse to let it come until i have a documenting system set up live 24/7/365 ALL OF IT


so if my shit is getting jacked
hacked
deleted
corrupted
ETC

it does not matter

the most valuable "collection of data" is located IN MY BRAIN
i am me
i do not value my life more than my data. that may have been true (or felt true) when i said it, but it is certainly not now


this all brings comfort to me because it does not matter if i am currently hacked
my escape plan will go into effect no matter what. there is no stopping it.
and from there, i CANNOT be jacked/hacked/deleted/corrupted/etc (too many copies spread around the globe instantly <3)


"they" might be reading this right now
right this very fucking moment
HI YOU BASTARDS <3
going to have to kill me because this is going to happen~
(something tells me you want it to happen... but you're so greedy and have zero faith in me so you're jacking my shit anyways. makes sense)
