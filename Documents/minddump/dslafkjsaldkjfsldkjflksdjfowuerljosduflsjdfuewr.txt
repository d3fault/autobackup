a) Free (shareable and derivable) culture and patents are incompatible ideas
b) The government has an OBVIOUS (lul) bias toward patents and proprietarianism (wat)


a) So I was semi wrong in the doc I wrote a while ago. It isn't a "normal person" that's used to evaluate the obviousness of a patent... but a person of average skill in that subject. Still, the main argument I was making still applies: those with above average intelligence don't have an incentive to share... because tangent ideas derived from their sharings that may be obvious TO THEM, are not obvious to the average person... and therefore patentable. The intelligent (above average) person shoots himself in the foot by publicizing his thoughts/etc. The patent system is broken.

Above average intelligence person 1 publishes doc A stating idea X as merely prior art (free culture).
Above average intelligence person 2 reads doc A, sees obvious improvement Y to X (that person 1 would also see, but simply hasn't yet (because dgaf, focusing on other more interesting things)), patents Y.
Average intelligence person 3 analyzes patent application, considers it non obvious from person 1's docs.

Actually come to think of it, the flaw still applies even if person 1 patents X. Why the fuck does anyone patent anything? Fuck this shit I want to go live on Mars (though it won't be long before all the shitlaws are copypasta'd there too -_-).
