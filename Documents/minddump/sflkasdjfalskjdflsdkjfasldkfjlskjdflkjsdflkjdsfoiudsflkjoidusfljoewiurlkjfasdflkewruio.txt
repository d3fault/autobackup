"Science Fiction"... isn't that a contradiction (am I late on the bus here?)?

Scientific theory also is essentially science fiction... in that they both explore the infinite depths of the possibilities within the laws of physics (actually, fiction does tend to venture out from time to time).

I am interested in a smaller subset: probably scientific theory


Probable is a human word and requires a human to interpret. >= 50% sure is the best definition I could give a robot.

As an example, I think that the big bang probably happened. There is a lot of supporting evidence to back it up. As for your "that rock has a conscious of it's own we are just not in the same dimension as it" theory.... Yes it's PLAUSIBLE... it just isn't PROBABLE... so I am not interested in it [as much].


I do find/calculate/logically-deduce that infinite multiverse theory is probably true too.


There are plenty others and those are what I wish/choose/want to study throughout my life. Plain scientific theory is too much like fiction: there are endless amounts the human imagination can summon.
