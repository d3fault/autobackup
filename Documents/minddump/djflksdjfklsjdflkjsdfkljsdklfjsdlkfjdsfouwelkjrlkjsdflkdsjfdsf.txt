If a machine has one function: to create copies of itself. Does it have any utility to itself (covering my bases) or anyone else? The answer is no, all you can ever end up with is a crap ton of machines that can't do anything but make copies of themselves. But the answer is only no if the machine is perfect (and a perfect machine does not exist(?)): if the machine might make a mistake (be it once every 10 copies or once every 5 billion copies -- it doesn't matter [because there is infinite time]) while creating a copy, then that machine itself is/can-be a source of evolution (and even consciousness itself -- implied with evolution). It is possible (though I wouldn't bet on it) we are the remnants of such a machine replication series gone berzerk that had snuffed out it's original inventor (ancient species X). Mistakes are necessary; mistakes are inevitible. Maybe/probably: "the lack of mistakes is impossible".
