The universe is necessarily defined, therefore finite (excluding infinite vacuum surrounding our spherical universe). Anything finite is relatively insignificant when compared to infinity, which is why infinite TIME is probably the major... "factor"(??)... in the emergence of a life form (us)... and is why we will probably never encounter an alien species. They either existed long ago before we were around (so did we ;-P), or they will exist in a really long time from now (so will we ;-P).

Aliens existing is absolutely possible and is already proven to be [possible]. We exist.


Of course it's certainly possible within the laws of physics for two life forms to emerge simultaneously and for them to discover each other (hell, even possible for them to discover each other at the same time) and I would be quite pleased to encounter an alien species... but it's just several orders of magnitude orders of magnitude improbable. A single life emergence is [likely] rare enough and [likely] takes a metric fucking shit ton ("accuracy above all") of time to occur.
