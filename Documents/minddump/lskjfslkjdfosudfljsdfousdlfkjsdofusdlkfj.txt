One either cares too little or too much. Hitting the sweet spot is near impossible. You can choose which side you're on and adjust accordingly, but doing so causes you to eventually cross to the other side. Choosing to care too little and then incrementally caring more as life goes on, or choosing to care too much and then decrementally caring less as life goes on... both strategies will lead you to be opposite where you started eventually. Our brains are not smart (had:powerful) enough to detect the sweet spot when it comes and to then stop and stay there. Very likely, a single event causes you to "jump" over the line to the other side.. you would have needed a smaller event to land on it perfectly (what units of measurement are we using? who the fuck knows).

I thought of this when stating to myself: "I either care too much or too little, I am unsure". But then realizing that that's the case even without the poetic meaning I was aiming for.

Holy shit it feels good to be typing again... damn video compression...
