why should i have to pay for internet?
why can't i be:
a) solar powered
b) distributed / a fucking wifi + lan + file sharing software (d3fault) to communicate with other "lans" (people walking around)

or instead of people looking around it can just be a satellite grid that covers the earth and is free for all to use.
every square inch of the earth(-earch) is recorded (at at least some resolution, varying by whether water or land? etc?) and covered with free internets

free internets is more important than the camera installations. but maybe they can be funded/purchased by humans (but they HAVE TO be shared else paranoia will exist). sure there will be rogue nodes but they can be shot down? should they be? i guess if not responded to. mb we should just board them and/or land them and just turn them off or disassemble them and study them but they probably won't be interesting at all so in the grand scheme of things i think it will become just shooting them down or not because they're boring as fuck.
am i saying that i am boring as fuck?
no because i am not a flying satellite
but in some sense i am doing exactly what the satellite is doing
the satellite is running the same "lan" / d3fault software stack as the person below
it is an unmanned node
