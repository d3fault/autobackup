I feel like I've been here before, infinite times. Not just deduction that makes me feel that way (as I should always feel that way via deduction), but a weird sense of deja vu. The realizing that CleanroomWWW might fail because of the game-ability of the round robin slave selection... is what made me feel like I could "remember" determining that in past lives.
