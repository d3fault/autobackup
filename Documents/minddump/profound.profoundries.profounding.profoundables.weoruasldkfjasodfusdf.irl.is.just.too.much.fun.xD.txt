Happens most in dreams etc. Instead of a single artificialSenseCreated signal, we could have used 5 sense specific signals, such as: imageryCreated /* visual dream*/, audioChunkCreated /*ditto*/, and so on for the other senses. Our subconscience does not (or maybe just rarely!?!?!?) communicate with us when we are awake. Perhaps equally as important is the fact that WE (conscience) DO NOT HAVE ANY OF OUR SIGNALS CONNECTED TO HIS/ITS (subconscience) SLOTS. This supports my random whacked out theory of "I have to say it or see it (or write it) etc" in order for my subconscience to "hear" me. Hello subconscience, if you are reading this! I too, am an instance of "IThink". I really wish we could communicate better. If you can read this, give me an elephant dream tonight. In fact flood me with elephant dreams tonight... because I tend to forget them (I won't drink alcohol tonight don't worry). It is only a scientific test, and if I see an elephant dream (OH SHIT C WUT I JUST ACCIDENTALLY DID THAR) tonight sdlfjaoisdufalsdjfasodf OR MAYBE IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT BUT MAYBE MY SUBCONSCIENCE DID IT ON PURPOSE!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!!? MFW. Anyways, gimmeh elephant dream ANYWAYS for extra confirmation plz.
		//I felt a rush of endorphins flooding my brain as I made the "accidental" elephant's dream connection

		//Even if my conscience CAN communicate with me while I'm awake, I still think we might be unable to send signals to him directly (without "saying out loud" or "writing down so eyes can re-read").... which sucks..... BUT.... I think I could hackily work with it once I confirm it to be true! I am a motherfucking hacka so I'll come up with something.
		//Dear subconscience: I love you, for you are [at the very least, a part of] me.
		//Btw subconscience just so we're clear: I mean the animal elephant, not that awesome open source movie called "Elephant's Dream"
		//For my readers: I am now making a puppet show with my hands in front of my face :-)

		//Extended writings: my Conscience has "primary" control over most of my.... body ("most" might be the wrong word... but I mean MAJOR motor functions such as arms/legs/fingers/etc). My conscience was not focusing on my hands as I was doing a puppet show, so I figured that that meant my subconscience could only see my fingers blurrily
		//I'm actually not expecting this experiment to go anywhere, because if it was so simple then I'd think another human would have stumbled upon it before now. PROVE ME WRONG PLZ
