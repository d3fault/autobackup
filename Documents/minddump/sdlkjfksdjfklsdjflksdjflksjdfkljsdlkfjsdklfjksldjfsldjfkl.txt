I kept searching for the perfect way to do a thread safe, request context agnostic, and variable amounts of request/response args... in a generic fasion... but I finally realized that since I'm an Rpc Generator, I don't need that (in a sense, I _AM_ that). While writing the Rpc Generator, I tried to solve that problem in code, but finally mastered my understanding of Qt signals/slots + boost::functions (the first two "request contexts" supported in this first version) and realized that the "non-generic" code (that I was so desperately trying to genericize (abstract, etc)) would be generated.
