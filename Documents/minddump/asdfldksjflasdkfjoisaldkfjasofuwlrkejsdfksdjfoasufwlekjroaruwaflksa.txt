"anonymous" should be replaced with the word "faggot"
it is coincidal/beneficial to us that "op is always a faggot"

it is also a way to do two things
a) make faggots seem less annoying to the average human. tolerance levels would skyrocket i think
b) discourage/encourage something. discourage anonymity and encourage names

actually this idea sucks because then it in a way says faggots can't use names. not at all what i'm trying to accomplish by borrowing the word

just a failed attempt at brainwash
