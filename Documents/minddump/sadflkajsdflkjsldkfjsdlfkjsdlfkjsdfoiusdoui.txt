Whether or not I am the smartest person in the world is irrelevant because I don't want to operate in the assumption that other human beings exist. They could be shells of humans that are reading a script that my singular brain (subconscious!) is creating. All the code that I could outsource could be made up by my subconscious. While it's highly unlikely that this is the case (why? "common sense" doesn't cut it), there is no proof indicating that others exist. "I think therefore I am" is a powerful piece of logic, but it only gives a bit of confidence for YOUR OWN existence. I think therefore you are -- doesn't make any sense at all! Maybe "I see therefore you are" (etc), but all of those have the prerequisite of "think" so ultimately say/prove nothing. "I think therefore I am" has nothing to do with whether or not this world is metaphor or actual. It is ONLY an assertion of existence. It is not even an assertion of control/free-will.
