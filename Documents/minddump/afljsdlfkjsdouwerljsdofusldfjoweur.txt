basically i'm supposed to drive a metaphorical stake in the ground (RIGHT AT LAUNCH) and say: "everything i did/said before this moment, i was stupid/learning/insane"
you are born stupid
you learn in school
and then you must GO THROUGH insanity
insanity is a stage of life
we are evolved from nothing
most people live and die in denial of it
"religious people"
i wouldn't be surprised the least bit if there are insane/denail ("religious" ;-P) people in formal politics already. i'm 99.9999% sure that 99.999% of them are... i just don't pay attention to brainwash/media so i haven't a clue
stallman took the "advocacy" approach, which is a dead-end
formal politics has results! after the results are satisfying, you can move on!


but eh having to process soooo fuuuuckkkingggg muuuuchhhh [boring] bullshit is making me question whether it would be worth it
i think most of the decisions would be somewhat painless... but some of them wouldn't be my specialty and i'd have no idea which way to vote (until i took the time to figure them out.... BUT that takes time! time alive is finite! gah!)
it is irresponsible of me to say that i'd only focus on things that are of interest
perhaps i should just be a billwriter instead? do i need a law degree?
having a vote is much more powerful
if i was just a billwriter, i'd be prett much just an "advocate"
none of the politicians would listen to me (though what's to make them listen to me if i am a politician too? sure i "get the floor", but nobody has to care/listen)



i like that i'm not running out of things to do
i like that i'm now trying to weed things out
prioritize what to do
it makes me quite confident that i'll never be bored
there is so much to do
if i run out of things to do i can pull something that i "weeded out" out and work on it
i have direction. feelsgoodman
