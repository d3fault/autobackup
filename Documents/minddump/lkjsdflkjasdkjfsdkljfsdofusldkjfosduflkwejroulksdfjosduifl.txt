We, humans, are the most sophisticated/advanced/powerful DHT in existence. Existence is our "system" and each of us are a node. The problem, however, is our coordination. We do not. We fail at it. We put up "walls" and hoard information and secrets and power of all kinds. Every man tries to (and has to, thx gvmnt) stand for himself.
