'leave me alone'
'new OS for my brain'
we are just programmed anyways
our 'OS' is random() and insane
i need to be alone to mold a new OS/brain
a lot of it involves actually writing C++ and building robots

i need to be fearless
declare myself above everyone else
'leave me alone. i am doing no harm to any others'

'in my programmed world, drugs are used to help reach higher levels of knowledge'
(obviously insert shit about being smart BEFORE you take the drugs)

but i need to be fearless
ignore everyone
including politicians
it would either be top story news on every news outlet first day
or it would be ignored/censored

if it was ignored/censored, i can expect a lawsuit eventually
or a raid immediately?

who knows
i need to be fearless
and i need to be absent of any crimes

i want to say don't smoke on camera
but i should
i need to be fearless

not only because it's necessary to LOOK fearless in order to not be bothered
but i also want to live without fear
both.

it is unhealthy to live in fear
that is our current programming
it is bullshit.
