Software is where theory goes to become practice.

Elaborating (deserves it's own paragraph so as not to detract from the awesomeness of above): anything that is theoretically possible in software, is also [practically] possible.


I was watching the new Jurassic World trailer with Caydon and in response to the line where they say "it kills anything that moves", Caydon asked why it kills anything that moves. I said "idk blah blah" and then after a little more thought said "it isn't smart enough to be nice".


"Life" is trademarked. Fuck Jurassic Park, that's a much better example of how stupid Earth 2014 is.


I just now changed the word "comes" to "goes" in the first sentence of this doc. Just sounds better. I think goes might have been the original thought -- while I was writing it, it seemed off from how good it sound[s now|ed when first thought up].
