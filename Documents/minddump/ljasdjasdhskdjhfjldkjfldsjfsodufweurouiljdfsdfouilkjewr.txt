The only reincarnation/afterlife is decomposition. Your personality and/or memories are certainly lost (as the physical constructs that hold them are destroyed: same as if you put a hard drive in a food blender). To believe (had: think) otherwise is just wishful thinking.

He will become food for worms. For microscopic organisms. Etc







In a weird and very true sense: I am caesar. At least one of his molecules (trillions) is bound to have landed in my body at some point or another (billions of humans). Maybe not but eh the chances aren't bad really.

I can't understand why they won't freeze themselves. It seems like suicide to me.

I want to declare war on Religion. I want to declare war on stupidity (already have ;-P). I don't want to get murdered but seriously ARE YOU FUCKING RELIGIOUS IDIOTS SERIOUSLY THAT FUCKING STUPID JESUS FUCKING CHRIST JUST KILL YOURSELVES NOW IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO FREEZE YOURSELVES SERIOUSLY I CONTEMPLATE REFUSING TO COMMUNICATE WITH ANYONE WHO REFUSES TO FREEZE THEMSELVES (GRANDPARENTS INCLUDED) AS I SEE IT AS A WASTE OF FUCKING TIME BECAUSE MY GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE AND IF YOU ARE JUST GOING TO COMMIT SUICIDE THEN I AM BETTER OFF MAKING PEOPLE WHO ARE _NOT_ SUICIDAL MORE INTELLIGENT THAN WASTING TIME WITH YOU. ME SPENDING TIME WITH YOU IS, IMPLICITLY, MAKING YOU MORE INTELLIGENT (though not guaranteed etc).
