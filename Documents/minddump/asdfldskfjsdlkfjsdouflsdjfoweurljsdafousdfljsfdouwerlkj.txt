Native binaries are like raising a tent with each side staked into the ground (representing the libraries), whereas interpretted binaries (Java, C#, Perl, PHP, etc) are equivalent to inflating an air mattress for which to put your entire tent on top of every time. There are [rarely used] precompile/pre-interpret settings for some of them that do in fact make them equal to being on the ground.
