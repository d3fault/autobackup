holy shit this ape singing song in jungle book is fucking amazing. love the way they dance and just FLALE AROUND and make random ass noises. inspiring, really. especially when the main one gets up on the pillar and does a dance and shit (right before doing jump rope with his arms :-P). i really can't fucking wait to get fingers up and running. my life right now sucks
