I am, in this moment (or at least earlier when I thought of writing this), not wanting fame at all. I will miss my privacy and think the idea of me being a public figure is ridiculous. I don't want to be. I use this fact/feeling as assurance in convincing myself that I am not an attention whore. Fame is a price to pay for the benefit of a complete lack of paranoia of being jacked. Paranoia of death, or shame, do not factor in at all. The only benefit from sacrificing my privacy is the removal of the paranoia of jacked. Since I don't trust my subconscious I am unable to state with absolute certainty that I do not fame. My subconscious could be craving it even while my forelobe does not. Regardless, I am going to pursue the launch (fame is side effect) because I win in either of the two situations: (1) - I want fame, I get it; (2) - I want paranoia of jacked to disappear, I get it.
