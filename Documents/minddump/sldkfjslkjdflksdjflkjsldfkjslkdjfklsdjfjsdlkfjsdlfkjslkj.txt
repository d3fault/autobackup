I have the right to pursue happiness, but that doesn't mean I have to pursue it. When the pursuit itself makes you unhappy, it's better to just stick with your right to life.


"He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster" (Friedrich Nietzesche). The "free market" is where these monsters live. In order to pursue happiness you have to fight them. In order to not die, you have to fight them. But that's not what it says in writing!!! In writing it says I have the right to life. Yay I have a phrase to refer to to back my argument, and it has a pretty high precedence. Too bad these same monsters run/own the government and ignore their own words all the time.
