I guess for years I've thought about this "leap of faith" [into better living], and now that I'm actually standing at the edge everything's different. I mean, nothing's different REALLY, but it's still much more difficult to ACTUALLY jump than to fantacize/plan/prepare-for it. Worst case really is death (actually prison rape is probably worse), and idk it's just err yea you know like ehhhh taking balls and meditation and such (and of course, trying to reassure myself that it's the right move (impossible) tends to make me consider every single aspect of the world eventually.. and I get lost for hours/days until I remember: a) there is no certainty, b) IMT says that I will both succeed AND fail. I'm at the "testing" phase of ABC/HVBS and just bleh. Not only is testing extremely boring, but it makes me feel like I'm already done (I am, technically) and so I skip right towards the jump itself. Writing install/run/testing docs is easy as fuck, but I still can't/won't do it because.... idfk. Because I'm at the edge).

It's also weird/scary-as-fuck that the software itself is what I'll be depending on to survive. Like err it gives a whole new meaning to bug fixing. I just want to code for fun.
