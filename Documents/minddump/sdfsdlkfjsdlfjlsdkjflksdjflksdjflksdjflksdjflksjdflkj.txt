You know it just kind of hit me that the bulk of the video is going to be me coding, not my sexy face. I had a few moments of "ok so after the tattoo... then what? I do a jig? Sounds boring af", then laughed an evil laugh when I realized that what I'm doing right now (typing (gonna h4x/code in a sec)) would be the main video content. Obviously I knew it deep down (I coded MouseOrMotionOrMySexyFace thing), but it never really clicked (or mb it clicked *again* just now) that I'd not have to rely on my storytelling/talent-show/etc abilities to amuse the audience.
