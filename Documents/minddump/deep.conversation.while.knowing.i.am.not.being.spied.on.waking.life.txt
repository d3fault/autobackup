i can't comfortably have a deep conversation unless i _KNOW_ that i am not being spied on
all the tactics i do: removing cellphone battery... going into the wilderness... etc... only bring me to 99% at best
in order to truly KNOW i am not being spied on, i have to simultaneously record and broadcast
record so i have a copy.. and broadcast so i know everyone else has a copy
only in knowing where the data is flowing can i truly be comfortable
i must defeat shame to attain the same level of deepness that i aquire while alone. this is something i can't start working towards until i am broadcasting
but in broadcasting, i instantly defeat paranoia


....watching 'waking life'. paused @ 'do you remember me?' ... 'no i don't think so'
the scene before is what got me thinking
they're just talking in some parking lot with buildings around
i couldn't do that
i'd think the buildings have mics/video and my thoughts would be stolen

stolen meaning someone else takes them, repackages, and re-releases.. taking my credit
or even  using the knowledge to further their agenda (power, monetary gain)
i am willing to share.... but stealing is something else

it is eating my brain
this movie is great, it makes me want to do something with my life [moreso than i already do]

i'm all in
definitely broadcasting
but i still see a kaylee potention
i just can't plan wat do with her
even though i want her more than i want the broadcast plan
maybe i'd still broadcast (together?)
i simply do not know

sometimes i think i should just forget it and go ahead with broadcast solo
others, i am confident she'll say no and i should just get it overwith
but deep down, i want her to say yes. i just don't know where it would go from there and that's what makes it interesting
solo broadcasting route seems somewhat predictable

still accomplish a good deal of things
but predictable nonetheless
