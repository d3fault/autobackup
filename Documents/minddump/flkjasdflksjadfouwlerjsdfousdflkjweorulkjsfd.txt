PIAR
Proprietary Influential Accidental Ripoff


In a state where one is disconnected from the proprietary world altogether, but his peers are not.
His peers' output which is NOT proprietary is subtly (or not so subtly) influenced by a proprietary works.
Whether the influence is accidental or purposeful, the person in a state of disconnect from proprietary medium has no prior knowledge of it and accidentally rips it off.

A LIBRE/original (original enough to not be a LEGAL derivative and fall under the same copyright etc) derivative of a joke/meme could recreate the very same meme that it was derived from.



I will probably do many of these. Some will probably even attribute it to plagairism or stupidity on my part.
