so, going forward (launch+), i know i need to be open/free/libre (cc-by-sa)
but the question became: what about my past? my work so far?

and i feel this question is very difficult


so i simplified it to two questions (similar but not the same):
can i attain [ecstacy? forget what word i used here] without releasing my past?
can i attain ^^^ with releasing my past?


the answer to the first one:
NO


nooooooooooooooooooooo
i cannot
because i'll _ALWAYS_ have something to hide

and smart brain diggers (hello you) will probably extract it
bits and pieces
or the entire hard drive contents itself (by extracting my password[s])


and therefore the second question becomes irrelevant
i tried to answer it anyways...

and the answer is MAYBE

a MAYBE is infinitely better than a no.


it is not guaranteed
but it becomes possible

whereas if i cower
it is impossible.
