cohesion
the same reason i need to be a symbol
or a rallypoint

because people need to single something out and refer to it
whether a company or individual

there needs to be cohesion

so when thinking about how tons of my ideas can/will be jacked after i release them
who really cares?

i'll have community

not only that, i can re-jack free copies of my own jacked ideas (assuming they're licensed properly)
...or i could suck them up into my own community. i should do this so as not to piss anybody off. and because i didn't earn it.

however

there can/should/will be only one place where you can see all of d3fault's ideas in action: d3fault

tons of various sporatic singular ripoffs

none with cohesion

trying to understand the internet
trying to understand open source culture
trying to understand human interaction
trying to understand the human mind (and how it prefers to rally behind things)

taking advantage of them all, i will prop myself up
my name
my persons

d3fault will be many things
and they can/should/will all interoperate smoothly

100% Qt/C++ Native LGPL
Wt is GPL
but i can/should abstract the presentation layer away to make that irrelevant (and so i can make my own later)
