I thought I could do both Jobs' and Wozniak's job. If time weren't a limited resource, I probably could (at least better than I'm doing now). I'm realizing though, that marketing/business stuff is boring and time consuming. I'm clearly a Woz. I still want to do shit on vidya 24/7 ofc, but I hate the feeling of "I gotta do this business/marketing bullshit X" (it isn't worth caming, and there's an endless stream of tasks in that category). So I'm wondering... who should I pick? I want a Jobs puppet. I wonder if all along Jobs was really Woz's puppet (doubtful, but definitely possible). I'd be fine with letting my puppet pretend that I'm his slave coder bitch (let him have the limelight).


Or eh maybe I'm fine with being the face and the brains, I just need to outsource the paper pushing and tedious/boring tasks. I guess either case could be true. Outsourcing anything is a foreign concept to me. I get it and grasp it completely and I see it's value, but I never do it. I need to start, but lol money~. It's funny because it too is a bootstrap problem: need to outsource more to get money to outsource to begin with. I guess that's what angel investors are all about. Meh, I'd rather shoot myself in the brain with a 12-gauge shotgun than give up my freedom of expression/speech.


It's still a longshot, but my path now is "MusicFingers" -> sell em (outsource the selling of them entirely (have someone in mind for that), and offer them a % (of profits only, 0% ownership) instead of cash up front (that I don't have)). I think WASDF is a better name for them, but eh it's still shit. How about i-Fingers loljk fucking dumb (and honestly we live in such a stupid world that there are probably trademark issues with that)? Yea fuck the name who cares can/will decide that later, *goes back to writing import script*.
