1 - 0 = infinity
because you can always add another 9 to the end of .99999[...]

Train of thought leading up to it:
The fear of death [from launching] is lower than my desire to live/exist/[launch]... in that the desire to live/exist/[launch] is INFINITELY HIGHER than the fear of death. Proportionately/relatively (though not absolutely!), my fear of death is 0 (remember, relatively only ;-P) and my desire to live/exist/[launch] is 1.

I probably explained this poorly but I might have said something mathematically. Or I might have discovered for myself something already known. *shrug*


Me ATTEMPTING to elaborate (might just be getting stupid from here):
1 is infinitely higher than 0 because there is no relativity when dealing with only those two numbers. 2 is exactly 1 higher than 1 because we have relativity by then. When dealing with only 0 and 1 (not in the binary sense like computers (or maybe yes in that sense... tbh I have no fucking clue but my instincts say it's not the same)), there is no relativity so there is infinite units (decimal places) in between.

I mean yea there are infinite decimal places in between 1 and 2 as well.... but [...something someone else will figure out...].


If I just discovered something, I'm too stupid to fully understand it :).
