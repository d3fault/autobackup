How2solve Israel vs. Pakistan ongoing war (or whatever country I forget)

Show up on American soil and then when caught without a green card / citizenship, say "deport me". They now have to deport you to your home country... BUT YOU HAVE NONE (isn't that the issue?). So they'll either find a place for you to go or let you stay. Probably the latter. Now you have a place to stay. Problem solved.

America deserves this because they stick their nose in. "World Police" etc.
