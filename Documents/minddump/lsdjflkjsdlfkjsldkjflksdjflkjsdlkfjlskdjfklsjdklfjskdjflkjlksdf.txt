The foldable keyboard I've been carrying around in my right pocket for a damn long time now stopped working. I tried, since a long time now, to add a password to my OneKeysRulesThemAll kdb shit.... but couldn't even fucking login as user:user. I examined the consequences of ignoring the problem "for now" and solving it later (another keyboard? fingers impl becomes keyboard driver?), but there is still the problem (which was the sole line of this doc while I stared at the problem): even if i add it later, it won't show up with the checksum on mah dih.
That's kind of a big problem, especially for what the key is. I am tempted to use another regular keyboard I have laying around, but it's been used with my online box plenty, and it's bulky etc and doesn't fold so I couldn't carry it around in my pocket (can't promote it to high security). The train of thought kind of got lost here, but basically I ended up thinking: "If I'm willing to get let my [private] bitcoin keys get compromised, what the FUCK is the point of even TRYING to earn money in the first place???". It's a good question, and this fucking hardware failure causing security failure is really pissing me the fuck off (but really the problem would have had to have been dealt with eventually anyways).
