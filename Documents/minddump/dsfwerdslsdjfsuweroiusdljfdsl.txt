I was on a car ride with my at-the-time girlfriend and her little brother just a few years back, my late teens, when I realized I had been using the word "trivial" wrong for years.

I thought trivial meant something difficult!
Trivial Pursuit is a difficult game with simple questions~
I used the game to infer a definition, and landed on the fact that the simple questions were DIFFICULT (I didn't even consider the fact that the questions were 'simple' at the time... just that I thought the game overall was quite difficult)
But as it turns out, trivial means "simple" xD. Sure felt stupid there...
