had a thought while staring at ducks the other day
trying to just 'be a duck'
going for that 'they have such a simple life i am so jealous' thing

anyways:
we are all ice skating on mounds of complexity
we have paths (comfort zones) carved into it that define how we live

everything is complex beyond our means of understanding
the duck is ridiculously complex (though he doesn't understand himself)
the muddy dirt field he was playing in is ridiciously complex (micro-organism ecosystems at the very least... but even just the geometry of dirt mounds)
the rock i was sitting near has more complexity to it than all of the data on all of my hard drives (perhaps even the internet)?

we barely understand reality. we are ice skating on a wealth of information (we are the 'bleeding edge' of evolution)
