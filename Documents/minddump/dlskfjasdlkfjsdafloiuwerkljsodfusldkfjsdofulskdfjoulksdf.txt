Good by default.

Since bad will increase paranoia and shorten my life/freedom (death and prison, respectively)... and neutral is doing NOTHING (if you do SOMETHING while attempting to be neutral, you will either be good or bad accidentally)... I will be good.

I don't have that implicit urge to be good. I am not even sure it exists. I also don't have the urge to APPEAR good so that I can gain political power (definitely exists) or respect (jealousy) etc from my peers. I will be good because I want to expell all my energy into SOMETHING and I have calculated that it is stupid to be either bad or neutral. It is not the accomplishment/reward that I seek. I know that life is pointless. It is the enjoyment of doing an activity. Funny how I've read that "it's the journey that's most enjoyable" shit quote since I was a kid. It didn't have much meaning to me though. Sure, I understood it perfectly. I just disagreed with it :-P. Back then I believed in accomplishments and the like.
