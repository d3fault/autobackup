What differentiates a premature optimization and COOL IDEA BRO is a deadline. Fuck business and fuck proprietary and fuck money and fuck deadlines.

However, since I have a deadline (launch), most all of my cool ideas (bro) are premature optimizations. I am getting antsy. I am afraid of this future but I am unhappy not moving forward. This "LifeShaper" task seems endless. I have a ridiculous amount of content. It gives me a headache to even think about trying to process it. I want to just take a screwdriver to my hard drive and start fresh. I could utilize ambiguity way more.... perfectly.

Perhaps there is an item on my drive that will land me in prison.

An illegal idea.

Fucking politicians.
