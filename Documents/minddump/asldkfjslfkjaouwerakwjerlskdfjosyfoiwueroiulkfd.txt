receiving music that is told to you by a 3rd party to be released under a creative commons attribution license is legal immunity to the you
you prove/show-logs-of (in this case, emails) the receiving of said albums

and when pressed/sued, you ask/question how it is possible to know that a work is copyrighted when it is given to you in good faith (blogspot domain/email addy is literally free to set up rofl) under creative commons attribution. you extend this argument (not valid yet) by asking what you are supposed to compare each sampling (individual audio piece in music) of each part of each song to? we have a collection of samples to compare against with respect to libre content. where is the db i am to compare to with respect to copyrighted content? how do i know if there is a violation if there is no copyrighted content db to crossreference my libre db against? safety measures cannot be taken. i guess 'cease and desist' is a notify... right? so i guess i have to respond to them

i never thought of that actually
a cease and desist

i mean like say copyrighted shit
of course i'm going to get fucked and sued and lose
rofl

so i need to stick with/endorse only libre content
in good faith, i can/should respond to dmca notices

after > 50% takeover, everything becomes public domain

before 50% was reached we would need to have world hunger/shelter solved

fucking easy if you ask me

doesn't it really just boil down to massive network grid of arduinos controlling idk wtf like giant mega grid (x.y.z) of fucking soundproof inter-network-linked cubes
but why motors? i mean do you really need to move your cube?
i guess yes
yes absolutely
fuck yes
your car is your room is your house is YOUR personal space is you is not that expensive to propel naturally

i wonder if my pulley infinite energy solution i thought up actually works and can be used to propel the xyz grid
that's all it should be called
xyz grid
free food, free shelter
for 1 entire human being
how could you do 2 anyways?
should you even do 2?
marriage etc?
temporary joins? temporary shares? other just becomes storage unit? see now they could sell it as a storage unit
ok fuck it fine yea why not
they will anyways if they dont' use it
and that is their right
but who will buy it?
i guess people that want space
but if we guarantee/promise 1 xyz grid per human born (that person OWNS it and cannot sell it until they comprehend what that means (oh god FAMOUS LAST WORDS 21)), there won't be a huge demand for spaces anyways. or will there be? idfk. should we not allow selling? you can't prevent it if currency exists.
