My father, and many others, use the following reasoning to "prove" there is a god: "there's too much (miracles) around me for there to NOT be a god".

Who the fuck are you, that you think the universe has to make sense in your puny fucking human brain? Yes the world is complex as FUCK and there's tons of "cool shit eh" going on each and every second. That's chaos + infinity hard at work. Giving a god credit is faulty reasoning: jumping to conclusions.
