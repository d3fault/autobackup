i just watched 'the other guys'
weird conspiracy theory movie
but doesn't seem that far fetched at all
in fact it seems very realistic
maybe less PUBLIC gunfiring, but yea...

my point: something like that wouldn't happen... or would be less likely to happen... if the 'hero' was broadcasting his every move 24/7
