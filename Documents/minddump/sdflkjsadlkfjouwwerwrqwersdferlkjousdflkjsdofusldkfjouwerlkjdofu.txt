If your opt-in privacy software/tools are closed-source, the paranoia remains. Fuck Microsoft, Google, etc. This shit needs to be free software and there is no business that will make it (because there is no working business model for it). So I will. For fun, for lulz, for epic, for FREEDOM OF PARANOIA [for myself], because I can, because the world/universe needs it, because it's the best and most fulfilling life I can think of in this era (though I wish I was born later and could just reap my own benefits), because 'they' won't do it, because manifest destiny (same shit as 'best and most fulfilling' rly), because fuck you.
