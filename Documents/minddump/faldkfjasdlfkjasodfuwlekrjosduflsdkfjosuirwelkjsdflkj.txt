i need a massive fucking import app/script
my brain hurts

should i use git?

custom?


none?





I NEED TO MAKE A 'TIMELINE' PROTOCOL/STRUCTURE/FORMAT ANYWYAS: FACT

git does not play nicely with large files or repository

i want the 'entire fucking internet' to be in one repository


so.......

idfk.


but on the shorter term: should i use git :-P?

because it's here and it works





.....
.......


idfk.
fml



i hate thinking about this


but i also need to fucking code something asap



not asap
but... soon.



i want to merge and be able to check (git gc) everything on every drive periodically

it will help me sleep better




FFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKK



how to get a working dir:
git clone
./fixTimestampsFromCloneByUsingTouchAndPullingTimestampsFromSomeFileThatGotCloned.sh





right now every time i clone i lose timestamps
KIND OF

they are still in that file

but the entire file gets rewritten and all the files have identical timestamps (the time of the clone)
disgusting.


that script won't be too hard to write

but it makes me wonder like where i should store the timestamps
yea i already have a solution for that

but i've never parsed it

though i could.


and i also need to err



account for those erroneous timestamps
'roll back'

i need to be able to parse that timestamp file
and git repos
and i guess even svn repos

and i need to get the earliest timestamp
but then again: NOT
the earliest would be the creation date, but it does/should get updated each time it is modified

oh god my brain hurts.


and then factor in merging all the 'sources'

and then asking me what to do with each file

finding diffs (potential corruptions)




aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
