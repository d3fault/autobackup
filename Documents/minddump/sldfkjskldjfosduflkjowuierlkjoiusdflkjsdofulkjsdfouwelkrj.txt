Two thoughts that brought streams of tears to my face just a bit ago: "I want to spend time with Caydon now (not NOW NOW, but... now). It is his summertime". "I want to be isolated from everyone now (ditto) so I can code and shit without distractions". They are both NOW wants and they contradict each other :(. I am... or have to (but not really!)... choose myself :-/... and that makes me sad as fuck.
