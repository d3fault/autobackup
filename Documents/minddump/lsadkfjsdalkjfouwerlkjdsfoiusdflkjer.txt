the only thing anyone can ever hope for is: relaxingly sanely doing something they enjoy
rich people don't even get there
either aren't relaxed, always trying so hard to get more money or protect it or maintain their image or lots of (infinite) reasons tbh
sanely: some people, though it's probably rare, can relax and do something they enjoy for their entire lives (lots of artists might fit into this) without being completely sane. for example, they might be religious. or they might be atheist and just not have figured out "life" to the extent that i believe i have
doing something you enjoy: this is where most people lose. they get jobs and forget their dreams and then just die. whether relaxed or sane is irrelevant because you can't ever (usually! you MIGHT get lucky) really "get into" (have purpose, fulfilling life etc) some random job that someone else has assigned you. you are just an instrument/tool to THEIR dream


that's a "lifelong" accomplishment. it sticks. it is a feeling. a way of living
it is still true that "the only accomplishment of man is: 'whoah, i had some pretty deep thoughts bro'"
slightly depressing except when you've actually had the thoughts
they are orgasmic to HAVE
orgasm is 100% mental
so it's easy to understand how thoughts can be equated to an orgasm (perhaps even better tbh)
i fucking love drugs
