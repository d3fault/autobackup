Imagined conversation between a politician (obabo) and me:
Them: You expect me to film myself taking a shit and while making love to my wife? That is unreasonable.
Counter: You expect me to give you power/control over my/everyone's life and then to simply trust you to do the right thing? _That_ is unreasonable.
