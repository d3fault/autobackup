For a giant public dht full of free/libre content, the default action for a viewed item should be to just make note of it. Maybe we might hot cache it early on, but our long term strategy is to discard it (there would be OTHER copies that specific nodes would be responsible for holding (and you'd have your own range as well if you were contributing)). The point of this doc is to introduce a new category/tag, aptly named "If I were locked in a room with my computer and no internets, I'd want to have this file handy". It's pretty obvious how the flag would perform. Whether or not the "who is responsible for what files" takes these opt-in flags into account is another question altogether.
