Virtualbox is only handy for testing because of snapshots. I'm starting to hate it otherwise. It just crashed my fucking devbox (took down the HOST). Luckily, I didn't lose any data. I think I need to change my testbox to be another physical machine (and that machine should itself run Virtualbox (only for snapshotting)). Arguably, I shouldn't even compile on devbox. Arguably, I shouldn't even remote deploy from devbox. Arguably, I shouldn't even scp/rsync from devbox. Arguably, I should not run devbox. Still, my compiler (or hell, even QtCreator) have never crashed my devbox host (actually QtCreator did once during an accidental drag-n-drop (hover, to be more accurate (I was passing OVER QtCreator to something else (so yea now I make sure never to do that lmfao)))). Virtualbox is starting to crash often enough to piss me the fuck off (which really, is maybe like.... 5 times in the past YEAR (it's always right near the startup of the VM guest for some reason)... but that's 5 times that could have been avoided if I wasn't using virtualbox!)

I'd have raged if I lost all those recently written multi-threading notes :-X


It's been bad enough for a while that I've been running "sync" before I even launch Virtualbox hahaha. I _EXPECT_ it to crash. This last time was nail in coffin, I need an also-encrypted clone-of-devbox used JUST for testing. A while ago I was using a live DVD. While that sure was HDD-safe as fuck, it ended up being a pain in my motherfucking ass :-P (couldn't become root, and was slow to boot (rhyming pun (patent pending)))
