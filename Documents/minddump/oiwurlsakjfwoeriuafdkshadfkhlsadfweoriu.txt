i am insanely paranoid entities (such as google, but definitely not limited only to them) are watching my every move
shit i just re-convinced myself
ok so i was unconvinced for a bit
"if google wanted to watch me so much, why would they deny me youtubes partnership"

they don't actually want you to launch
because then they can't spy on you
they don't want anyone to launch

cost of launch = bandwidth
essentially
plus all my time lost
