platform (generator (bootstrapped) + some basic apps): in
tangentify (in one of the "basic apps" (writer)): in
dht: out. should be a project created with the help of the community ON the platform. be active. attract people solely because you are active. in all honesty, the security and sheer complexity of such an application seems far beyond me. i could never release and expect to make a profit unless security/stability was there... which i don't even know if i'll ever see in my lifetime... that's how complex the security problems are. i can't wait forever, even though i really want to
timeline'ing: i say in, but definitely host proof hosting. i refuse anything else. it should be less prioritized than the other two, but having it doesn't sound that hard to implement (****while not using a dht). for videos, pictures, the whole "social networking" aspect of it (which by default does NOT report application data for your friends, but can be configured to do so. like it's own "facebook"/"messaging" service but with simple checkboxes to either allow one of your feeds to be read by friends or to opt into any of your friends' allowed additional data feeds. there needs to definitely be a "social" appeal/area/mode(?)). for timeline'ing the creation of applications, i say it's just as vital as the code written itself. audio timeline combined with keystrokes replay == way better than just having "the source" public. it's a way to spread knowledge
nobodyme: i don't know what the fuck i am doing with this. i want to take over the world, but i'm too much of a bitch to say or do anything. i want to take over the world as d3fault.. i don't know what i'm doing with nobodyme.
