Life demands that you're either submissive or dominant (neutral = submissive). Makes sense that I consider being a sex slave or a serial killer; they're both the "extreme-est" versions of each. I don't like half assing things (well ok that's a lie but eh I guess when I'm planning things then I don't like half assing the planning).

Neither one of those are good ideas, of course.

I feel as though I'm rejecting the world's demands ("be submissive or dominant"). I will starve to death because of it (meh, just leeching off my parents ffffff sorry mom).

I guess when I say "life" in the first sentence of this doc, I really mean "this shitty fucking system we have here now".
