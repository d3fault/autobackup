My eyelids were semi-transparent. I felt like I was in control of two bodies. My eyelids-open one (steven) and my eyelids-closed/tripping-balls-andor-lucid-dream one (name = ?). I could toggle between the two at will just by opening/closing my eyes and I tested it multiple times. I wanted to call the president from the closed eyes one. I envisioned barrack having his final thoughts as he drifts off from old age death, thinking back on that phone call he got where the guy only said "I am in a lucid dream right now" and then hung up :-P. Of course I envisioned also staying on beyond that and perhaps bringing up the subject of drugs and "where we stand" ("I am a good person but am labeled evil and feel hated by my government because I do drugs"), but that was a funny little blip.
