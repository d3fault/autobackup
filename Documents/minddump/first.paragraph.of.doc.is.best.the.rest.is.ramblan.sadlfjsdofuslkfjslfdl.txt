I was sitting here staring at DasButton code, the cursor blinking to be more specific, trying to figure out what to do next. I decided to stare at it until I figured out what to do next (I made an exception for this doc). I said to myself: "are you pissed off? good. enjoy it. forcing yourself to enjoy it is the key to enjoying life". BUT, "Enjoy being pissed off" doesn't make sense. Logical contradiction. As soon as you enjoy it, you are no longer pissed off. There has to always be something that pisses you off, otherwise you lose relativity and eventually become numb from 100% enjoyment.

This doc is progress but I'm still a little confused on the implications.

I think there might be a masochist exception: a masochist can still differentiate between pleasure and pain, they just trick their mind into... tolerating (enjoying?)... pain... as well. That's what I was trying to get at: I need to enjoy the challenge. But bleh, challenges [sometimes] piss me off and are therefore not enjoyable. DasButton for example is fucking tedious and boring as fuck (coding shit backwards and undoing previous work and blah). Zoning out into the cursor, depriving myself of sensory (well, music is playing but yea) etc, does err ehh uhm help me forge (though enjoy? probably not)
