I've found a definition for "accomplishment" that I like (before now, I hadn't been able to think of a single thing that I could do that I'd consider an accomplishment (going from too high to too low :-P)). Bah I can't remember it exactly but it was basically my observing/studying "free will" itself that led me to this definition. Something about "anything that you wouldn't do because you would regret <- the OPPOSITE of that". So anything you do and don't regret is an accomplishment. I think perhaps "anything you do and if you didn't do it you would have regretted not doing it" might be better, but really these are all saying pretty similar things. So: eating is an accomplishment ;-). Damn suddenly I am so fucking successful at life :)
