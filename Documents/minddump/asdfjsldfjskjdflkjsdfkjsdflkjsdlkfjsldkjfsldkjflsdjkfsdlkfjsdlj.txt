The blue/green/turquoise feeling I had is best described like this: for the first time ever, my brain felt (the feeling has somewhat gone away now that I'm balls deep in code and debugging various bullshits (but will probably return once I chill the fuck out)) like it was a clear glass of water.

It was sort of like that one night where I felt like my brain was untangled [some], except more complete: every molecule felt in place (my ENTIRE brain felt untangled, not just (relatively) huge portions of it).
