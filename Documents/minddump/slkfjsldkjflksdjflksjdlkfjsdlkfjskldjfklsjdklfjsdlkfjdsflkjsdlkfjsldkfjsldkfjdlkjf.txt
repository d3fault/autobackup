I'm at the finish line (I've said this before, I know xD) and I'm stalling. Been kinda mad at myself for it, but then I realized this is some pretty heavy shit, so I can spare a few days to think about it.


In the free market (US&A economy circa 2014), the only way to get ahead is by putting others further behind. To argue otherwise is a clear indication that you suck at math. We as a species are smart enough to bootstrap ourselves out of that natural/stupid ecosystem/economy. We are capable of building robots to provide for our basic needs (I know this to be true because I can build them), but we are too corrupt to ever get such a change implemented.

I'd rather eat PB&J for the rest of my life than a steak every night, if it means I have to put a peer behind in order to get a steak. (But really this is just an example, because there's no reason robots couldn't harvest steaks for all).

Even with our basic needs accounted for by robots, greed and corruption and currency will probably still exist. Food/water/shelter would at least allieviate the NEED for us to compete with each other to survive, but greed and pleasure and addiction won't be going anywhere anytime soon. Still, mathematically enforced equality would be a step closer to perfection.
