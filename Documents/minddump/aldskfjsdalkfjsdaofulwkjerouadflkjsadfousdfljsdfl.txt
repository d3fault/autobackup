'submit to ignorance'
vs.
'submit to god'

i know i've thought about this PLENTY of times
but i dunno if i've written about it...

ask me to elaborate and i will

.....but you should be able to derive my entire speech from it





(lol ok guess i'm writing it [possibly again?] anyways)
submitting to god is bullshit
it is a claim to know the answers. SSSSS. all of them.
the answer is equally bullshit: god did it. god made it. god is responsible.


we might as well just stop searching for answers if we 'submit ourselves to god'

there is no question any longer and there is no quest for knowledge. science is a waste of time.






if we all 'submitted to god' then modern medicine would not exist. we would all die at the age of 30. fuck you idiot religious dipshits kill yourself. don't use my medicine you contradicting asswads.




submit yourself to ignorance
"i am retarded. i know nothing"

it is a starting point from where we can ask questions and gain answers
even if the answers are just THEORY (the 'theory' of evolution (hate it when idiot christians try to use that as an argument against evolution. l2 logic or i will shoot you in the face (thereby upping the average IQ of the world instantly/instantaneously)))




zzzz this rant and ramble and rage against idiots (religious) can go on forever. jordan mcdonald's facebook post a while back is what initially triggered it
