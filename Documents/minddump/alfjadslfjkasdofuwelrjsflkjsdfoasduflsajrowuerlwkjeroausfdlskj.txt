i like my quickdirtyautobackuphalper SOOOOOO much idk how to even explain it

it just helps with sanity

my old fedora setup called scripts on startup and shutdown to mount the tc containers
which meant they were mounted whenever the machine was on


i would never want to leave the machine on.
(sure they are supposed to spin-down... right? (no clue))


i just know they're way more likely to not be spinning if they aren't even fucking mounted




that and typing fucking commands and manually pushing and then infinite tree dir.structure committing and then not being able to use a commit message with auto backup... and with a commit message i lose the tree dir structure and the auto-commit so then i'd try to find some random reason to make a file and then auto-commit just so my previous commit message would be pushed to the 2x750gb drives

basically i want this:

whatever-os/working: autobackup is clone of text, ETC ETC however the FUCK i want. don't have to clone binaries, don't have to clone music...

750x1: /text/,/binaries/,/music/
750x2: /text/,/binaries/,/music/
1TBx1: /text/,/binaries/,/music/
1TBx2: /text/,/binaries/,/music/

also, implied: /hddRoot/lol (container), /hddRoot/sdrowssaP/Passwords.kdb, /hddRoot/sdrowssaP/old.passwords.kdb

so everything i described is inside of 'lol'

5 fucking copies would make me feel so much better

especially if i could easily check them for bit rot with git fsck <3 <3 <3 <3

also have a 500gb laying around in case i shrink it enough... and of course i want to definitely make a non-magnetic copy. SSD or DVD-R idgaf but i do want one fo sho ya know?

right now i _ALMOST_ have the above solution except it's really only with my autobackup folder... so much shit on those 1tb files i want to get/track... but also a lot i should get rid of lol
