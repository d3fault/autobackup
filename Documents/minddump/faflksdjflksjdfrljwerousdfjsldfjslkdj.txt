is not the lyrics a work
is not the instruments [only] a work
how can one choose in which combinatorial format the work exists?
oh, i wish to release as song, therefore i combine a lyrical/same-as-a-novelial work(s) into a single work. the same applies to every category. a feature is an application is a work as an works.


to the extent you wish to split the combinatorial works is entirely related to how stupid you are
not always, but most of the time
most of the time a human clings to a single idea. it their only original thought, or it was just a `decent thought` that a friend recommended to them. them being stupid, they cling to that idea as if it were their entire life/destiny/whatever
