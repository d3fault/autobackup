I haven't attempted to calculate the math, but it may be impossible for anyone to be secure (in computing). By secure I mean they've verified every line of code etc down to the firmware of their CPU (and they've also verified the CPU itself! not just that the mask is secure, but that the CPU they're using (or have built ;-P) matches that mask). It may be that the sheer number of hours it takes to do that verification is beyond the lifespan of a human with modern medicine.
