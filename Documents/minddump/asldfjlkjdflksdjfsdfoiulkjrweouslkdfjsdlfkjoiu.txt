unless you are good, you are neutralOrBad.
if you are neutral or bad you are only harmful to your environment. you are at the very least, a leech, more than helpful.
your will needs to double back around and make up for the required fact that you are a leech, perhaps doing it for tens/hundreds/thousands/etc of others. i mean perhaps helping balance out the useless vs. helpful ratio.
being good is a choice and you must explicitly choose it and will it. it is not a natural state. we are neutral (and usually irrelevant (not referring to or negating what i said earlier about leeching [of resources (had: material goods and [resources] but resources covers both)]... but more in the... political sense)) by default. It is also easy to make the claim that all bad people are useless (unless they aren't THAT bad(????)), but I'm talking strictly about those who are largely bad. Those who do what I know I am myself capable of. Those who do exactly what I choose not do do [in my "pursuit of 'Good'"] (had: parenthesis instead of square brackets (means something?). had it all written out before changing it to square brackets after re-reading it).
