Rewatched 'network' the other day. What the fuck happened to the line "so who wants to kill [name]?" toward the end? Now she says it as a simple suggestion. I had remembered it (erroneously, apparently) as her standing up in the middle of the news room (lots more people than the 4 or so I saw this time) and asking it generally/openly to whoever wanted to middle-man the hit contract.

Movie actually made me more confident in my launch, especially the "good, we need all the press we can get" line. Yea they're going to try to shame the living shit out of me :-P...
