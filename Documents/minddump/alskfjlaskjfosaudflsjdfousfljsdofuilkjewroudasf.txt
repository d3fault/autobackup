I feel stupid using this computer now, as if all the times before I've just been in denial that I had security. Why even encrypt? Why not just put a stupid ass password on it to keep my mom/dad/bro out? Anyone even remotely worth their salt could hack this stupid fucking devbox that I let out of my sight all the damn time, easily. Carrying around all my data on my persons 24/7 is giving me mixed feelings. FEELS FUCKING GREAT on one hand, but makes me want to not use this devbox again. I am considering making a second box to also carry around at all time (thought about it just being another SD card, but eh even that has implications :-/). I like that this/my devbox has 3 drives in it that I am frequently synchronizing with.. I wouldn't have that without added effort on my portable linux boxen. I mean ideally I want to make a mini personal/portable cluster out of them for ultra redundancy :-D... but even that still has the downside of "if I get wet then the cluster is fucked". I need to be constantly pushing out to the internet... but not just any part of it: FREENET/etc. Idk all these security considerations are entertaining and I could implement at least a hacky "devbox on persons" scheme with relative ease.... but I feel as though it's a STEP IN THE WRONG FUCKING DIRECTION. I need to launch zeus damnit: figuring out privatized security is stupid/boring/always-hackable-in-the-long-run, etc.

I feel like I've been in denial this whole time. I don't think there's even much of a sliver of a chance that this devbox is NOT hacked. Hello illuminati/etc fags. Even my offline/secure box (err, the portable one, because I used to refer to this devbox as offline/secure xD) is fucking stupid because it has proprietary software and closed source VHDL -_-. KILL ME!!!!!
