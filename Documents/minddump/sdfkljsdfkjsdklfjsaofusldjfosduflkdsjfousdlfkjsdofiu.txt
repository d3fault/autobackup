I am the least serious serious person I know. I am the most serious apathetic person I know. Somewhere in the middle I make fun of it all (like this doc).

Bipolar comes with the territory, but I do a pretty good job of fighting off the depression (whereas on the other end of the spectrum, the mania is one of my best/favorite sources of entertainment). It seems backwards, though, that the more seriously I take things, the more depressed I feel (but it also makes perfect sense).
