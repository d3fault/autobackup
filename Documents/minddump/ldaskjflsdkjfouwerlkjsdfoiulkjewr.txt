i say vulgarity is comfortable
but perhaps it's really just empowering?
"AHAH! i am breaking the rules (except not. just social norms -_-)"
it sounds pretty boring when you describe it that way

do i wish to make public (private!? brodcasting yo.) nudity the norm?
do i want to ignore the norm?
or do i only want to do the opposite of the norm to be an rebel and feel "cool"?


lol @ me trying to 'logically' shape myelf towards kaylee :-X
