I'm a tad worried about my housing situation at launch. There is absolutely no way in hell I'll be here in my parents house, but it might end up that I have to settle for an apartment. My main concern is noise. I want to be ridicuously loud, especially within the first few minutes. Victorious yelling etc (cliche but oh so fun (I've been tempted so many times, and I always repress :-/)). So err yea I mean I'm worried that the cops are going to be called and like fucking kick my door in just because of that. I've considered "signs" on the door directing them to the site lolol, and more recently I've wondered if it'd be wise to give the cops a heads up to ignore such calls (I don't want a "boy who cries wolf" incident, naw mean?). But the purpose of this document is really just to highlight how incredibly hilarious the conversation between me and a copper would be. Like, err, what the fuck would I say... "hey uhh yeaa uhh I uhh am going to be uhh yelling into a uhhh microphone... and.. video camera... over the next... X.. minutes.... so... uhh... yea... if you could just ignore any 'complaints' (the worrisome kind).... yea... that'd be great". They would be so fucking "O_o". They'd prod with questions etc and honestly I don't think it would work. I don't know if there's any proper solution to not be bothered during those first few minutes except to do it out in the desert. I'm completely fine with that, except that I'm going to want to jump on my computer eventually and go into ultra code mode to FUCKING FINALLY implement fingers (honestly I'll have it up (alpha shitty fuck wryea) in the first 24 hours methinks). Desert = no comp :(, and of course internet is way more expensive out there as well. Very free world we live in, can't even be loud irrespective of the words coming out of your mouth -_-. It makes sense (safety first) but is also shit.
