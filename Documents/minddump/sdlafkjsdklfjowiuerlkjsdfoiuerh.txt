watched Menace II Society the other day, thought of this:
"Young, Hacker, Doesn't Give A Fuck"


I wish I didn't give a fuck, I really do....
I wish my life really were definitely finite: nothing to lose

ACTUALLY IT _IS_ DEFINITELY(? can we escape the great collapse???) FINITE

but i think it's worth being nice in order to be thawed and revived for a huuuuge life extention
and also seeing computers and shit


but if i knew i was going to die at like 20 (like in teh movie... lol i'm 23 now): i'd not give a fuck also
why WOULD you give a fuck?


i wish i didn't give a fuck and knew i'd be killed

it's weird because i am still pretty damn sure i'm going to be assassinated (thus pushing me towards not giving a fuck)

but yea yea infinite multiverse theory kicks in and i have to be good because in at least one of them i won't be assassinated and in at least one of them world war 5 won't revolve around "destroying frozen steven/d3fault" and in at least one of them nukes won't destroy all humand and in at least one of them aliens won't come and destroy our planet and in at least one of them we'll figure out how to thaw frozen bodies and revive them and in at least one of them the procedure won't have been performed wrong where i am brought back but only as a vegetable (assuming they can't fix vegetable states by that time (i'm guessing they can))..... and i'll get a huge life extension (not immortal.. but... INDEFINITE :-D) and get to experience forms of bliss that i DREAM OF (while peaking/tripping)


so, i do give a fuck :(
"Mid-20s, Hacker, Does Give A Fuck"
:(
it makes me sad only because not giving a fuck
going on raping and killing and stealing and pillaging sprees
throwing everything against the wall and not living all 'careful' and 'planned' and shit
sounds fun as fuck :-D
i'd surely be caught and/or killed
but nothing matters anyways: fuck it
