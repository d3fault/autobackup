Just got done watching jOBS. Was more inspiring than expected, and even got used to seeing Ashton's fucking face while watching it. Like a typedef Steve Asthon in mah brain.

I feel as though I am sitting on valuable information that is keeping society from progressing forward. We are in a fragile age, and it's worse than murder what I'm doing: wasting time. It isn't just worse for my peers, it's worse for me [too].

Analogy: I'm running on a soccer field towards the goal and suddenly the ball is passed up to me from underneath me (unexpectedly). Instead of kicking the ball forward (whether as goal attempt or pass irrelevant), I stare at the ball intensely... knowing what it is and what I'm supposed to do... but just................. paused......... taken aback.......... holy shit, this is life.
