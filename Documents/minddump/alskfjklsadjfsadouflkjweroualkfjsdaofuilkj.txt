Free Will only Free if not conflicting with another Will. Disconnect from all for true Freedom. The only rule is "do no harm".




There are multiple ways to interpret that, I just wrote it down asep so I could continue writing the previous document (as well as the header for the next one (a model my software should capture in the future)). However when I thought of it it was a distinct train of thought. The train of thought was that I have free will and I can do anything I want. BUT my pursuit of Kaylee has been shot down by Kaylee herself. She too has free will and I could/would not force her to submit to mine. That is really all there was to it, and then my mind went wandering off into all the other areas of it's applicability.

"Normal" does not exist if you are disconnected. "Respectable" (-Montaigne) doesn't either. There are no rules and everything becomes arbitrary. ESPECIALLY when you use visual overrides <3. To exist amongst others allows their wills to, AT THE VERY LEAST, provide for you a "norm" which is... most likely by your subconscious... mimicked and adhered to. Row row fight the power. Be unique/random/arbitrary. It doesn't matter if you are "useful" (like that fork pic). Life is meaningless: enjoy it.
