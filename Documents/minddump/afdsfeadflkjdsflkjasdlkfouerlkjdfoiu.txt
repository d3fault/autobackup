yesterday at dinner my brother said (to pass the attention from him to me) that i should go to my uncle/cousin's writing 'camp' thing. i withheld my response because, meh, idk if it's too good to say out loud or not (if it'd be stolen).

my response is/was: i like that my writing is sloppy.... or something along those lines. sounded better in my head
