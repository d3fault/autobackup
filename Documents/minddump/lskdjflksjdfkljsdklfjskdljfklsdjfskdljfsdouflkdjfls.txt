A while ago my mom told caydon he'd be taking a bath in the shower that I usually use. I guess he's never seen me use it because he said "I don't want to use Lexi's bath". Was hilarious/cute.

Just the other day I told Caydon about Achilles and Achilles tendon. A day or two later we were talking about hitting weak points on bad guys, and he said "or you could hit (cut) their hercules tendon".
