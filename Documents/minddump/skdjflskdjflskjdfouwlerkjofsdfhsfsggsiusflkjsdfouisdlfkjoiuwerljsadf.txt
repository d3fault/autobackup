My best discovery in everything I've written is probably: "fear of death = appreciation of life" (SHIRT (LOL)!). One stems from the other, therefore equal (but still very much NOT, if ya know what I mean). I am software on hardware randomly emerged. I am software on hardware randomly emerged with the ability to clone itself. "Eat" is dependency of clone: we need to sculpt our clone into something. From there it is simply logical natural selection: the clones (which have random slight variances) which fear death are more likely to survive -- even if they don't understand any of it [yet].
