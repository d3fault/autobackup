the immortality introcellular nanomachine

"when we're iin"

the nanomachine takes a snapshot of the cells at maximal human growth/knowledge-peak (21) and from then on try their very best to replicate that snapshot
they could request you eat certain foods containing resources the machines need to automatically fix you. they use the broken down proteins as individual payloads. they can/do replicate themselves for maximum efficiency (auto-calculated but definitely limited. we need to be mostly human (not necessarily... only our brain does)))
it is only a matter of the nanomachines getting small enough and the nanomachines being capable of molecular reconstruction. might be 1000 years from now but i'm more than willing to bet that it's possible. lol i have nothing to bet, what does that even mean?
