I am a bit scared but I am also very excited. Mountain lions and bears are my only concern. But I want to get out of this house and open up my mind. I thought of this yesterday and figured I'd speak it while out there... but fuck it I'll write it now.

I feel like I'm holding my breath in between speaking sessions
in between being alone
which spans months these days

I miss living by myself.

I mean fuck that's really all there is to that analogy.

I cannot speak, I cannot breathe
I speak, I breathe


lol @ my parents laughing at me when I said I'd be working by thinking.
all my rage----

SUPPRESSED
I didn't even give a shit.
I look down to them now...
I feel bad for them...

their 7 year goal I found

makes me want to cry.


7 year goal: pay off debts

that's about it...

then below it says what that unlocks for them or whatever

"fun" was one of the items


JESUS that makes me want to cry...

come on guys.
THIS IS IT.


but I can't explain that to them

I can only show them

so I suppressed my rage

I hope I'm not too late for them

Already pretty sure I'm too late for my grandparents :(


ya know, I think I might bring that heavy ass shotgun... fuckin mountain lions n shit :-/...

...but I'll probably never use it and I'll probably regret it because of the added weight ^_^


I think I'm gonna do a weight test in a bit, with + without shotty


no music
no drugs
just my brain and my recorder and the open desert/forest(???)
