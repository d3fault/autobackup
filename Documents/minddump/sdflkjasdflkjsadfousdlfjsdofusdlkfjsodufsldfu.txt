==The Ultimate Great Debate (Fuck: Religion vs. Science)==
Life is too short to spend all of it arguing with the infinite stream of stupid humans that this universe produces
vs.
Letting the stupid people be stupid and rule the world (as they do by default) will bring about the end of the world [sooner]


If I can determine that 100% effort towards trying to sway stupid into being smart and saving the world etc etc.... would still not be enough (I was born too late or whatever), then I can conclude that 0% effort is justified and I can/should/would live entirely in the now and for myself.

There is some inverse of the above that I'm having a hard time conjuring.

If, and I am (was) tempted to, I put 50% effort toward "the now" and just enjoying life [because we are all very likely fucked] and I put 50% effort toward saving the world (hurr)... it may seem like a reasonable strategy but a) 50% towards saving might not be enough and b) 50% of "the now" might not be enough to satisfy me. It may be that 50/50 is the only wrong answer.



Living entirely in the now is the only way to definitely win at least a little bit. It's a very dangerous thing to say because if it turns out that saving the world WAS within reach (<= 100% required), you'll punch yourself in the face for not doing it (and then you'll be dead).
