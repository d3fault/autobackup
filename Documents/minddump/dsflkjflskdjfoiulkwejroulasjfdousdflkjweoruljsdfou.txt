IF there is some kind of a war between Intelligence/Stupidity then I know we can/will win it with relative ease because I/we can/will utilize "hacking" measures to thwart propaganda attempts. Propaganda is essential to being able to fight a war. Except we, the intelligent, don't even need it. We have truth on our side. And we can surely justify "illegal hacking" to save human fucking lives. To thwart the Stupid with Power from keeping those... less fortunate ignorant... from fighting for them. We've reached the age of the internet, so war should be a thing of the past (lol oil wars).
