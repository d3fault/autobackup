all i ever have to say to anyone who asks is "i've done everything".
so i am simultaneously be saying yes and pleading the 5th.
so they can't say i didn't plead the fifth
err no, that i did. no, that i didn't.
so they CAN* say that i didn't plead the fifth.
see what writing this down does to me?


oh btw,
i do want to do everything
everything that i think won't kill me
drugs do not kill
unless you overdose
don't overdose.
