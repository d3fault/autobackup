the world isn't ready for me
but the world isn't 'ready' for anyone
or anything
everything that is
to me
to us
has always been
we're born into it
despite them being RADICAL changes for their time

that's me

future readers will care way less about me

i will be a 'hack' in 30-50 years time (maybe sooner :-P)

Good. I will accept that.

I will have successfully swayed the direction of the world.
Job complete. Life complete.

You fuckers can't foresee what I see

the disaster we're heading towards

it was diverted by me (hopefully us. i make software to share / communicate / improve the world)

suck my fucking dick.

you are born into leisure



THAT IS ENTIRELY MY POINT
so am i.


'computers'


HOLY FUCKING SHIT
neato fucking machines eh?


imagine a world with no phones/tv/computers

that was less than 200 years ago







universe is 15 billion years old
basic ass modern ammenities are < 200 years old


comparing them to scale like that makes my jaw drop (ok not really fuck off sluts)


I'm scared that I won't be accepted
but then I remember I don't give a shit
I don't completely control my thoughts/emotions
I want an 'easy' life
but I sure as fuck am not getting it


I am arrogant but I am right. Wait no isn't that a contradiction? Fuck it.
