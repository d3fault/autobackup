We live in an existence with sufficient complexity to enable a while true loop to be formed in chemical reactions. (had:and/or the laws of physics)


All I am sure of is that I am one. Zero exists only conceptually; it is non-existence. I am one that incidentally became/is self aware.


Chemistry and/or the laws of physics are all that's required for life to form... and logic is developed during the formation of life itself. Logic does not exist until it is perceived/understood. The backing for logic (chemistry/physics/math) is all there before life emerges, but logic must be thought before it exists. Suddenly feeling pretty great about only being skilled in logic... although I still want to learn physics/chemistry/[music].


Logic is the OS of our forelobe that slowly emerges on top of our subconscious, which is [??????????] <-- was tempted to write something like "more grounded in chemistry/physics/math".

Is our subconscious genius or retarded?
