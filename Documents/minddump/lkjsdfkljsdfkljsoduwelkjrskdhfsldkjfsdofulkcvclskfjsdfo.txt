I'm a little wind up toy car that goes fast in the direction you set it. The rejection of the love of my life is that toy car crashing into a wall. Now it's broken and goes in circles. That's all I have left: just to spin in circles really fast until I run out of energy and stop (die).

The analogy/metaphor is accurate, but oddly doesn't depress me (I guess you could say I'm over it). I'm just glad to KNOW.
