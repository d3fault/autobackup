was about to write my video shit
but now i'm leaning towards AdCaptcha
sounds so easy
could be a pure Wt implementation
but it might be smarter to do Wt + Qt
Wt for user interface

publisher sign up/config
advertiser sign up/config
(users can be both)
i just am not sure if Wt is suitable for sending a dynamic image, for example
i know it CAN
but it has ajax scheisa that isn't appropriate in that context
idfk.

i'd still need an http server if i did Qt
i could h4x one together
since all i need is GET /image?clientid=123&campaignid=etc for THAT portion of the system
and the javascript/ajax widget that embeds my image, what would that be in? can you embed a Wt app?


i also believe that if i'm going to make that framework, i should also include functionality for just images,... or even just text-based ads

if i abstract it enough, the video advertising might even fit in nicely.. though i'm unsure about this
i could just make multiple ad agencies

K.I.S.S.

AdCaptcha by itself is a million dollar idea (not that that's saying very much)
so it should be priority
a google buyout is most likely...
fuck it
