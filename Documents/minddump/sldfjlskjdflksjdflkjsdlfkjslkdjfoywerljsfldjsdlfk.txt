"I won't make a move unless I'm sure about it" == "I will not evolve"


It's much harder to love than to hate, especially when you yourself feel hated. I want to love my government, but I feel hated by it. I wonder if I really even should love it, with all the corruption and all. <- Do not confuse this with me hating/loving the average citizen. There's a huge difference between a government employee (politician or otherwise) and the average citizen, even in a government supposedly (a company slogan isn't necessarily true) "by the people for the people".
