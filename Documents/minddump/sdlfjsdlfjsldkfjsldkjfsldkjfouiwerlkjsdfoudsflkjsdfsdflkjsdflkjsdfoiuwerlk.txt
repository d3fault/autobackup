I think some suicide bombers might actually be justified. From their perspective at least. They might lack information that would change their minds (censorship/propaganda is a bitch), and we certainly/usually lack the information they use to justify their [final] action. The United States of America says that it is justified to meet violence with violence, so it's hypocritical for us to say that they (ALL of them -- I admit some of them might just be evil/dumb/manipulated/whatever) are in the wrong. If someone has their family blown up by a misplaced bomb, their retaliation via suicide bombing is justified BECAUSE OF their ignorance [of the fact that it was an accident].

The same applies to the more intelligent IED placers.


We live in dangerous times, sex (the creation of life) is deemed 'bad' and killing (the destruction of life) is deemed 'good'. Our rating systems (media is our lifelong schooling) are fucking backwards.


Life inevitibly declares itself illegal, so I'm wondering if public/decrypted is even smart. Should I say "fuck the police" and live by my own laws (do no harm)? I certainly WANT to be public, but who cares what I want? My desire for a thing does not necessarily make it worthwhile/smart-to-pursue.

Drugs (LSD, Ketamine, Shrooms, 5meo-dmt, etc) are illegal in 2014 on earth, but I know without a doubt that they are not universally evil.
