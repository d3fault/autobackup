Understanding where life came from (evolution) is easy and I have complete confidence in it (logic woot -- no HARD PROOF but waaaaay more than enough logical proof (imo)).
Understanding where our existence came from is difficult and might even be impossible for us to figure out (since we are "in" it).
The two issues tend to be confused.

If there is a god, he created our existence and not our life. He created the laws of physics and that is it. However if there is a god he's a fucking asshole for making existence so cruel.
