Random - what are you waiting for


GOOD QUESTION ILLUMINATI
what am i waiting for?

myself to code.


durr

make ABC
that is all
that is your requirement
are you fucking shitting me

make abc, figure out video shit (ez (will upgrade later/live)), shape life, make backups, upload to freenet, launch (release freenet decryption key, also at launch start a torrent containing the same thing. probably be featured on "the promo bay" (sup))





this sensory deprivation is more recent
i had limited input/output
but now it's shut off PRACTICALLY all the way...






did i mention that those individuals in the "think tank" are certified geniuses?
