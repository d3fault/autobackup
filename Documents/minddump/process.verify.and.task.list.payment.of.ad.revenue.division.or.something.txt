a controlled/compared processing/verifying-of-files task
which allows you to take part in the bitcoin/cpu-crunching lottery (upon winning your work is verified in full)
winning means you get the ad revenue that the system generates... or at least a portion of it.
each 'lottery winner' divides the ad revenue pool up once more
win once and you get revenue for your machine for a while
but you are still required to perform tasks
and perhaps they are even verified by someone else before each dispersement

how long do they last?
forever?

maybe it shouldn't be a membership
but an instant dispersion of bitcoins
the bitcoins come from the ad revenue
but they still have to win the dispersion lottery (sort of like landing on that one spot in monopoly that gets the money in the middle (but with a relatively constant/calculated prize)) by getting leading 000000s in the block chain
seeing as i'm doing the bitcoin protocol also, i might be able to call them d3faults. i really don't know...
