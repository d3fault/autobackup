being this outcast sucks
i need to launch
the options, realistically:
launch
stay quiet, die quiet
suicide


so i mean... there is really only 1 option, ya know?
i just don't want to be an attention whore, ya know?
yea i know

but fuck man
you're so god damn alone
and i know you're at least moderately cool
and can bring some things to the table

it's your life and ultimately your choice
but i think want to am going to  -- choose launch
man that was a quick fast fucking shift of words to be used
i thought them out didn't type them
but then typed them for significance

see, fuck symbolism
explaining and over-explaining until the point is definitely made/understood ('what is man' by mark twain repeats itself like 100x i didn't even finish reading it but 'i got it')

i'm just going to correct typos unless i think their remembering is worthwhile
but who am i to judge that?
it's my subconscious who lets them out
i have no control of it
if i did, i wouldn't make them.

i said 'got' instead of 'got' up above
oops   ^god
my explaination of a typo had a typo
is that my subconscious oh man i can't type for shit just now amde like fitty errands shtahhhhhhhh that was a brain typo errands but i CHOSE to type it anyways


i definitely want tuao recording of backspaced data
but it is up to me to CHOOSE in the moment if i want to backspace it or not
in that case just there, tuao... i like it.

fuck typos your brain can get so hung up on them.

back to being an outcast sucks

tis true
i need to train my army
and shit tbh i can manipulate current gens to do my bidding anyways
as long as my deeds are good, who gives a FUCK?

sure technically wasting their lives
but they're wasting them anyways

i could in a lot of circumstances be giving their lives meaning
they might enjoy the tasks i put them through
whether trivial or difficult
