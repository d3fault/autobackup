i should just say nothing
SAY NOTHING
to the camera
just code

launch, code
aka write
data stream of d3fault app realtime-view of d3fault channel
all i need to do is the source/binary integration and i have the timeline items i need
for source, i should commit on save, auto-save every statement creation/modification

do or don't record pauses? well doesn't matter since already committed/saved/timeline'd
i would say don't
because coding is all over the place


contexts are just series' of statements with possible sub-contexts that are also series' of statements
