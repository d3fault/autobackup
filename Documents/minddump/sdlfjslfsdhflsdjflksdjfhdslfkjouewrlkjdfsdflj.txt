The reason we're all fucked and there's so much stupidity in the world is simple: if a thing isn't profitable, man thinks it shouldn't exist. Yes obviously I'm just butthurt my [grand]parents didn't geef monies (not sure which fundraising attempt was fail-er (this one was also to tell them about my plans in general so they'd stop bugging me)), but consider the following: the human species is not profitable. Until/unless perpetual motion is ever invented, we will always cost our environment. Doesn't that mean that we, the human species, don't deserve to exist?

Capitalism is just legal permission to scam anybody/everybody. Everybody does it on such a large scale (meaning each scam is small) that nobody can piece together the stupidity of it all. You might think that it wouldn't mathematically balance out, and you'd be right: that's why the fed keeps summoning money up out of thin air.
