heidi is attractive, but i have only met her once when i was like 5. for me to say i like her is stupid. i don't know her. i have pretty much never even met her.


this makes me think that i am merely in love with the IDEA of kaylee. i am unsure of these thoughts and do not wish to commit to either direction. by saying i am definitely only in love with the idea of her, i am ruling out any chance of her approaching me in the future. there is probably no chance of it anyways, but i wouldn't want to block it by making such a bold statement.

i know kaylee MORE, but still not very much.


i'm in a weird state of mind. i don't know if i am insane. i am mentally stable, but i am insane. sanity is relative. stability is... not?



still kaylee is my cop out
an easy path to happiness
these goals become moot, as i am already happy
i pursue less

perhaps staying single is in my (or society's????) best interest



idfk.




idfk idfk idfk idfk, but they are both lovely women who... inspire me. their image does, both physical and [the other one]. even though heidi's is essentially completely unknown (aside from what i can... derive... from her facebook???? horse shit).... i guess it's just my vivid imagination taking hold.


i'd be down for a threesome, LoL
(whether sexual or otherwise)
