Due to the nature of this world, one can only save themself. At least I can do that. I want to go run around the forest parkour-danzig wearing wasdf (and hope I don't get shot) for the cheap thrill of it. bonus points for not hurting anyone in the process (the only way to win in the us "economy" is to out-compete (hurt) others).
