I can and will do whatever I will.
That self referencing (therefore self dependent) sentence must first define and prove "free will" before it can become Scientifically valid.
However, I am willing to (rofl) allow myself to override "fact" to include something that is not Scientifically valid, and that is that I can and do exist and have free will. I have already implicitly done it (at/near birth) because it is necessary to do in order to bootstrap the mind, but this explicit acceptance can be compared to my "Assumption that I exist". It is essentially just an extension to it as well: "I have free will because I will my mind into thinking it does (I do?)". That was supposed to be the "comparison" (or extension) next to "I think therefore I am", but it ended up being changed drastically from the original structure. I don't: "have free will because I have free will", because that requires that I first had free will (and I did, just didn't realize it yet). It is better logically to first state that I have free will and then to explain how the free will came about.
