I don't remember that taping of Edwin when he was obliterated, because I too was drunk (just not as much). I was being a dick to him because I was jealous that he was public and I am private. "Are you doing it for the fame?". Such a noob and revealing question (don't think anyone heard it except... Edwin... Google... and maybe Luke). I'm such a noob (and an asshole).
