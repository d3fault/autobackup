so it's settled then
i have logic'd through it as best as possible

attempting to find a real logical solution is to be a coward like series finale of House

launch
release [everything]

censor?
i guess that's the only question left


but thse censored stuff will always be buried in my mind and can be extracted


so.....

it should become


if(theMaterialWillGetMeThrownInPrisonForPOSESSION) //ceep
{
  censor/shred();
}
else
{
  //the material is embarrassing or might get me killed or whatever
  releaseLikeNormalBecauseExtractorsCanExtract();
}





i'm going to miss my self-made ceep :(
a part of me :(
fuck the government
fuck everything



HOWEVER
i would miss [MORE] the freedom to go outside and use the internet
because ceep = prison sentence.
