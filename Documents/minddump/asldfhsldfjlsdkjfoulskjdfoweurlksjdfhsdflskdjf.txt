I love that API isn't copyrightable. Rewriting Qt would be a breeze (though still extremely time consuming because of it's size). To give you an analogy: It's like playing KNetWalk with all the terminals already in the correct position. Placing the cables in the correct position becomes very fucking easy.

Btw my high score on VeryHard mode in KNetWalk as of writing is 1:10/152 O_O!!! Obviously no mistake moves, I restart as soon as I detect one. Fucking game is so addicting and I even hacked it out of boredom to use color coded teleport borders. Way less strain on the eyes now...
