The plus side to asking Kaylee out prematurely is that later in life she'll truly know that I've felt that way about her for a very long time. You know, should she change her mind (or rather, change her opinion about me (sameshit sorta)). I'm really.... HOPING... that that's what reality becomes. It would just be swell. (YO WADDUP BITCH)




It also minimizes the amount of time before she would approach me. The ball is in her court. She now knows I'm down. If I hadn't, then she'd just be like "oh look it's Steven eh" -- or something -- and the thought of being with me would never even cross her mind (or would it (or HAS it????)) until I approached her then. Now I have a seed that's growing. It needs nutrients and water (I AM FUCKING PATHETIC WHY WOULD SHE WANT TO BE WITH ME???), but planted no less.
