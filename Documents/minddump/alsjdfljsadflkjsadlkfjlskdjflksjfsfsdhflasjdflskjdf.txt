Abc2 + HVBS + tools should all show their stdout/stderr shits (maybe excluding the boring connection stream from wt) in a grid of tmux panes. This is one "system" and perhaps tmux windows can be used for multiple systems (but meh you should really be able to see it all). Of course all this could be done by combining the stdout/stderrs into one (err, two since stderr should stay separate)... but yea my errors suck and lack context so fuck that i guess
