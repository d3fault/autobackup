If suicide is not possible because you always either decide not to do it [in some alternate universe] or at least not die [ditto], then the concept of "death by natural causes" baffles the fuck out of me.

SINCE IT IS POSSIBLE WITHIN THE LAWS OF PHYSICS for humans to live indefinitely, then it's also POSSIBLE that Julius Caesar is still alive because he advanced technology so rapidly during his reign that technology/medicine figured out how to keep us alive indefinitely... before his death [of natural causes]. Therefore Caesar is still alive in some alternate universe.

It seems improbable but then so does our entire existence (err.. the life therein).

I think the only inescapable death is the collapse of the entire universe itself, the "big collapse". I could be wrong and it would be great if I were, but I can't see how we, matter, can escape the collapse of ALL matter.

Still, if I get a few thousand years out of this I think I'll be happy (but probably not).

I know I am not content with a measily "80 or so" years.

THEN AGAIN, time is really relative so perhaps if I am metaphorical Steven then I am born into this universe with the "fact" of roughly 100 years of life burned into my brain... for the first X years of my life.... only to then have that number lifted and multiplied into "indefinence". If it starts off as "indefinite" then it is not appreciated [as much]. The 100 years could have been the illusion needed to give me a "bootstrap"'d appreciated of life and time itself! If I were born indefinite then I would not have such appreciation.

The appreciation probably doesn't last... because indefinence is a really freaking long time anyways. But without the illusion of an immenent death (or maybe it isn't an illuision LOLOL WUT I AM GONNA DIE OH FUCK (<-- see? genuine FEAR)), appreciation for time is never formed.
