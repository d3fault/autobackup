My goal in life is for some fucking kid just born to be able to say: "Wow, that guy's fucking stupid"... while he/she is utilizing knowledge that I have.... dug up... found... researched... stumbled upon.... [during trips]. OR they can also call me stupid on software that I made :). Considering I don't plan on using ANY OTHER SOFTWARE, that one's very likely.

The point is, from their perspective, I should appear very very stupid. This is good. It means human knowledge has progressed. Of course they probably think other humans in this day and age (2012) are waaaaaay more stupid... just as I think humans a few hundred years ago are stupid. Average IQ increases.
