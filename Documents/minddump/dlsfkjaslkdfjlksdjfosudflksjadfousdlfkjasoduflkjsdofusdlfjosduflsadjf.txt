LifeJail: Since you are born into jail and live in it indefinitely (until escape), perhaps it is wiser to stick to the shadows DURING the escape process. Un-metaphoring: maybe I should stay private/anon until I can build a..... bunker...... where I can speak/act freely (to myself).... or of course until the world becomes safe.

Strive for freedom.... but restrict your freedom while striving for freedom until it is safe for true freedom.

Wat.


I like to think that since we're at the age of information, I won't be hunted with a mob and pitchforks as being some fucking mad scientist. ESPECIALLY since I'll give a fucking live stream into my [stream of] thoughts.

I like to think it, but I don't know if it's true. If we are there, we are JUST BARELY there. 50 years ago would have been unsafe. Today, /b/ exists.


Going back into metaphor mode: when you are escaping a jail/prison, you should stick to the shadows to avoid being seen by "the guards" (in this case, corrupt politicians, CEOs (corrupt by default), religious fanatics, etc)... until you can get out. Bah I hate this.
