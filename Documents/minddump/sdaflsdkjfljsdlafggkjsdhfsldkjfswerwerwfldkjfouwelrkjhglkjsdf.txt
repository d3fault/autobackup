I am afraid of Rpc Generator working because I am actually closer to finish than I realize. Yes there is a good amount of code left, but Rpc Generator will help fuck tons. It is like a tractor vs. a shovel. First you have to build the tractor (inb4 "first you have to build the engine" (or even: first you have to invent the universe ;-P) etc).
