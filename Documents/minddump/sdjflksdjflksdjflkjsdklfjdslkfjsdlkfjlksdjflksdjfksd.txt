Any good computer programmer will count on their fingers. They're just so used to something else doing the math for them. Your body's ability to respond to stimulus with ease buys you what appears free: the calculation of the number you are counting to (somehow, adding them all up on your fingers at the end (had:again) when you look at them, comes with ease). Counting upwards by 1 is also incredibly easy on the mind (but that doesn't mean doing blocks of 1 is just as easy).
