My writing style is garbage, but I enjoy it. I've yet to find out if I can continue with it when I have peer pressure, or at least the imagination of peer pressure (knowing they are watching me). Blah blah blah go into repeat mode again and say: peer pressure is mostly worthless. For things like [certain kinds of] art (and my writing is a art that I don't take seriously (whereas codan, I do)), peer pressure needlessly changes the way you do/perform/express it. I don't try to write [anymore], I just open up the valve at the bottom of a barrel. Writing as a profession must suck.
