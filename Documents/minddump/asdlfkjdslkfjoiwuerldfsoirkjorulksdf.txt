re: monogamy with kaylee and/or vs. others
it's not that i couldn't be monogamous with someone else
it's that i have no desire to
nobody else seems worth it
worth sacrificing the freedom of putting my dick in any hole i encounter
again, perhaps it's untrue. perhaps i might meet someone.

...but i will always wonder if they are merely a gold digger.
always.
there is no way to be certain about anything

it's why i asked kaylee so damn early

if, when i have money, she conveniently changes her mind: GOLD DIGGER
i'd still gladly be with her. i'd rather have her as my gold digger than anybody else

it might anger her at first that i'd call her that, but it think she understands logic enough to see where i am coming from: we cannot be certain of anything. and her earlier rejection sort of pushes me into saying: GOLD DIGGER


bah why do i cling to this thought so much? she's probably not interested dude. you asked, grats. now move on. there's a whole world of pussy out there



*sob*

i just want to cuddle with HER!
