I HATE THIS RPC GENERATOR CODE IT IS SO FUCKING UNORGANIZED AND CONFUSING. I WANT TO START OVER FROM SCRATCH BUT THEN THE THOUGHT OF THAT MAKES ME WANT TO SHOOT MYSELF (WHICH, INCIDENTALLY, IS ALSO STARTING OVER FROM SCRATCH). It's a nice metaphor for all existence up to this point as well. POWER THROUGH IT BITCH. QQ. Etc. Suicide isn't an option, nor is starting over. What would that accomplish?
