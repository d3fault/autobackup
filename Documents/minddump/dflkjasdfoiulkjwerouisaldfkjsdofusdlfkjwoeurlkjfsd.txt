My devbox should never again run something that was written on it. I don't trust even the simplest of bugs. I do trust stable and non-changing (stick with what works, don't use bleeding edge (at least not until you test it well)) development tools such as notepad and the Qt Creator IDE/etc (hell even compiling isn't scary to me (just to see if it does compile! for errors etc))... but the resulting output should not be executed on the devbox. Another small project could be the 'testbox deployment' automation (do i recompile on testbox or do i send him a binary? guess it doesn't matter lol idfk).
