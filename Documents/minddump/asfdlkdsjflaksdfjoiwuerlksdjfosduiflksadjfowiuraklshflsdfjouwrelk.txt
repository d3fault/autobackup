ip addresses are publically viewable [edit: on something like a "forum post", for example]
it is always the equivalent of seeing a tor exit node IP
whether or not they release the public decryption key is what makes it publically readable or not
whether it has a name attached, or perhaps is signed by a certain key, is what makes it attached to a given username (anon doesn't have this)
perhaps what makes something anon vs. not-anon is whether the user KEEPS the signing key or whatever "identifier" that is generated just for that item
they could release the item anon, keep the key, then claim it later bu publishing it
or just never publish it
or delete it
or publish it at the same time as releasing it

it seems implied that the key is an item itself
this seems like circular reasoning
the key is an item that requires a key that requires a key ad infinium

so perhaps the data storage level is a separate level (non-guaranteed pretty much) than the d3fault filesystem level (data guranteed, shifting to servers where needed)
and there are perhaps further abstractions or maybe abstracting it to d3fault filesystem is enough to say "this is a piece of data" vs. "this is a key that unlocks a piece of data" without the circular reasoning
a solution can definitely be attained

i need to design well.
