bah today's code was a bitch but i'm glad i got myself back to a stable point. compiled/tested first login detection (not even any functionality behind it) and really just glad it fucking works
i need to not get ahead of myself. BABY STEPS MOTHER FUCKER.
still, i'm all coded out for tonight... it was giving me a headache and i mentioned killing myself numerous times haha
i know what needs to be done. i know what baby steps i need to accomplish.
