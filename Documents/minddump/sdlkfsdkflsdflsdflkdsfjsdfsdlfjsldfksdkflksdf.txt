As long as politics and government mix, there can be no freedom for the masses.
Sadly, politics and government are so intertwined that they are practically synonymous. That doesn't mean they always are the same thing, just that they always have been so far (in the history of the human species).

Politics spreads everywhere. Households, the workplace, and of course government.


An earlier variant of this doc was "as long as business and government mix".


What politics is, simplified, is human nature.


It's often stated that emotion clouds judgement. That it's better to be objective rather than subjective.

The selection of our laws need to similarly be objective.

Hivemind is the ultimate goal (every human logically deduces a reasonable opinion and votes), but evolution is extremely slow and most people are too busy surviving to learn the issues well enough to even form an opinion.

Government officials (was tempted to write: "politicians") are dangerous and extremely vulnerable to corruption. <- derp (common knowledge)
^Even if people were capable of hivemind, government officials stand in the way (and they're not about to relieve themselves of their power).

This doc is bullshit. Waste of words.
