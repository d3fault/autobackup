"Who else is leaving messages like me?" -me in an old vid

I shall soon find out. They'll see me go public, get a little butthurt jealous (as I would them), and then go public as well. I would like to meet you good sir (or miss).

But the idea/concept is sort of destroyed once I go public. Anyone that hears of me can't then start to do it [without feeling like they're a copycat etc (feeling like a copycat would get to your head I think)].
