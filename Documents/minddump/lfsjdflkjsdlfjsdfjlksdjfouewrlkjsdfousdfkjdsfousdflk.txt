Caydon was talking about playing halo on "really hard" (probably normal at best xD) and saying something about aliens helping him and how he didn't die or some such (maybe he was playing as arbiter, but I really couldn't get much out of him). I kept asking "did you win?" and he finally admitted he didn't know, to which I replied: "If you don't know if(that?) you won, then you didn't win". I kinda liked it and it reminded me of another quote by someone else I can't put my finger on (I can't put my finger on him (literally/physically) or the quote (datagraphically (or literally/physically)))
