The insanity invoked from being born when/where I was and taking the path that I've taken (programming (the state of which also depends on the date) + drugs (ditto, but for very different reasons))... or am taking.... is not easily reproduced. I think that I grew up in California in my younger years also has an impact on who I am (etc). Most people grow up dreaming about moving there... whereas I can safely say it's overrated and I don't give a fuck. So many variables...


Bit rot is still an unsolved problem in 2013, are you fucking kidding me (gah need2code dat git submodules autoshitfucker l0l0l0l)?



I hope nobody else ever has to go through it, but I know I will over and over and over (because I believe in infinite multiverse theory).
