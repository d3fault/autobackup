The argument "I don't need drugs to enjoy life" is weak. First of all, most who say that haven't actually tried drugs... so they don't know what they're missing. Second, to abstract the argument and reverse it on you (analogize): "I don't need tasty food to enjoy life". It sure is true we could all survive on bread and water and nothing else. Tasty food (steak, ribs, hot wings, candy, etc) just enhance life. So do drugs.
