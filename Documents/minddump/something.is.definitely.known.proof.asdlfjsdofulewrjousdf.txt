Something is definitely known because when trying to determine "whether or not something is known" (lol pun because you can replace 'something' in those quotes with anything) there are only two available answers to us (there is no logical in between): Something ("a thing") is either known or it isn't. So regardless of whether or not something ("a thing") is known, we have learned that SOMETHING is definitely known. We don't even have to know the correct answer (although using "nothing is known" you get a nifty infinite toggling effect :-P) to whether or not "a thing" is known, we just have to be aware of the mandatory fact that there IS an answer, and there can't not be, logically.

Mite b sum Philolsophy 101 wtfz do I know~

It definitely reads easier if you use "a thing" whenever I said "something" followed by "a thing" in parenthesis... I just love to fuck with people's heads.

WHO EVER THOUGHT TALKING/THINKING ABOUT NOTHING COULD BE SO DAMN INTERESTING/FUN <3
