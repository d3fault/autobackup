train of thought: "vulgarity does increase my chances of assassination, but i am not going to consider that anymore as infinite universe theory (which i am relying on for existence already) means i am always still alive in at least one"

that is where i caught myself and thought "so then i will be a reckless blatantly stupid fool? there has to be a stopping point (then i started writing to catch up) (which is where i realized i DEFINITELY need to start talking/thinking because it is a time saver. just like "Music" (accidental capital M), i shouldn't need to stop "thinking" just to start "wiring" errrrr "typing" lol typo, i meant to write writing/typing). i can keep up with myself, but i definitely have to think slower. this slower'ness might make more more exact. i argue that talking has just as much of a gain in exactness as typing does, because it forces the thoughts to go through your forlobe either way. your forelobe is wrong significantly fewer times (typo: types) than your subconscious. shit often doesn't make sense in dreams/subconscious-thought. subconscious thougt because you are dealing with abstract thought primarily and dreams because the events that happen in dreams often are and can be/seem completely real and even be controlled/aware-of-it-being-a-dream (lucid dreaming FTW)


i wonder if lucid dreams are my new high because i don't do that much drugs anymore
my brain desparately searching for something "trippy"
i mean, my subconscious?
you cannot forelobe'ically request a lucid dream. well i mean you can (i have), but you cannot induce one at will.
