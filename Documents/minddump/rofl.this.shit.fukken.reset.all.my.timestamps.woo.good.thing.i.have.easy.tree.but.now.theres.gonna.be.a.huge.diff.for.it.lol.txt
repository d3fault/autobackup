a test commit because idfk i'm paranoid as balls now that i realize I cloned my bare git repo without specifying file://
so it used hardlinks, 'if possible'
what the fuck does that even mean?????
does it check that the source/destination are on different mount points (and it's impossible if they are?)
i sure as fuck hope so

how have i even been able to commit etc?
and run git fsck?

seriously pretty sure it shouldn't have even worked if i was dismounted, hardlinked to a file in the dismounted, and then did a git fsck

still i don't trust it!!!
so i am doing a git clone file:// this time

and then i just git remote rm origin to make it forget about /media/truecrypt1/autobackup/ forever :)
