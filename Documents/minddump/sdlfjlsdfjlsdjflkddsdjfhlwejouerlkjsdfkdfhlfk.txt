Had a sudden "brain reset" a few nights ago. I was just laying in bed and right as my left touched lexi, I felt an electrocution go through my head/brain. Felt like from the top->down, and it made a sort of pyramid as it went. Or maybe the pyramid was pointy-side-down idfk. It was sudden as fuck and there was even a high pitched accompanying noise. Sounded like a computer resetting tbh. The noise and pyramid were vivid for just a brief moment but then faded over the following seconds. I did/do wonder if it's a genuine health concern. I also wonder if it may have been drug induced... just been smoking a little lately which is not normal for me (money reasons).

Obviously I attributed it to IMT. What I experienced was a sniper rifle bullet piercing through the top of my head. The light jolt of electricity feeling, pyramid visual, and strange high pitched sound, were the last "moments alive" in some alternate universe where I am now dead. The feeling of being electrocuted was pain that could not fully manifest itself in time (before "dead"), and since I died so quickly I, I was still laying in bed in the exact same position in a parrallel-up-to-that-point universe (one where I am still alive).

Bleh doctors probably have diagnosed this symptom, zzzzzz. Still I amuse myself by repeatedly theorizing the same thing over and over.
