The "free market"/capitalism/economy-of-usa-on-earth-in-2014 is best described as a see-saw. One side cannot be up (successful) without the other side being down (unsuccessful). It's just plain and simple logic. Hypothetically/ideally, both sides could be level.. but that never (or 'rarely') happens in practice. What we end up having is the slightly more intelligent and slightly more ambitious taking advantage of the slightly less intelligent and 'slightly less ambitions -> lazy'.

How can a person claim to be good and be ok with pushing someone else down in order for themselves to go up? I am not ok with it, but I will still take advantage of it because the alternative is starvation. Unlike most, I'll bitch about it and point out my own contradictions at every step.

We need to restructure government in order to fix it, but bleh good fucking luck with that~

Our government/system(incl. economy) is like a brain tumor that's taken over. With today's technology/medicine (metaphorically equivalent to [???]), we're unable to remove it without killing the host/brain. Best to just enjoy what time we have left than to try to operate. Or maybe that's just my cop out so I don't have to try [to fix it (I'll certainly try to enjoy my life!)], I am unsure. I am exactly 50/50 on that subject, contemplating flipping a coin to decide it for me etc etc. Or maybe spend half my time trying to fix it and the other enjoying my time (I've written a doc explaining how that formula could be 'losing' compared to the other two (tl;dr: 1=not trying to fix it, just enjoying only. instant success; 2=trying with all your might, and succeeding because all your might was necessary). I'm born at a pivotal point in time, though that statement is probably always true. We're always dying; the moment you are alive, you're dying.
