the movie "two for the money" helped me get to this:
everything we do in life is a gamble
risk for reward
risk worst case scenario = death
reward best case scenario = *
there is no avoiding that equation
...and I haven't a clue how infinite multiverse theory factors in (allegedly it would negate all of it; but in practice, does it?)
