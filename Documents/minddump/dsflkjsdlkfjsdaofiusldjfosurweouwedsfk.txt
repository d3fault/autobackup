Input manipulates me, therefore my output manipulates you. The only way to remain un-manipulated and un-manipulating is to IO deprive yourself. Do not speak to anyone and do not watch TV/Movies or read books. Whether the manipulation input produces DERIVATIVE (in copyright law) output is irrelevant and a different (though still interesting) subject. It has been said that "code is law" (some guy who won some FSF award), but I would argue that words are too (though code is still a stronger and more influencing law :-P (tongue face because i r 1337 h4x0r sup noobz)). Everything you do and everything everyone else does modifies everyone that encounters it. The degree is dependent on the subject matter (it is possible to get more stupid from accepting input (see: Fox News), for example), but it happens with everything.

My sitting in silence does not benefit me. I am missing out on "time" to manipulate the world around me to my will. Calling it manipulation has a negative connotation (in line with sociopath), but ultimately the only difference is intent. As Montaigne says: our actions are and should be judged good/bad based upon their intent, not their actual results. I mean obviously we should learn from and avoid "bad" stuff happening [with good intent], but to judge a person and label them as "evil" for accidentally doing something bad (when they had good intentions) is erroneous. Obviously that can be faked (the 'good intentions').
