on a cosmic scale, i am repeatedly accomplishing nothing
i emerge, discover myself have these deep thoughts, and then eventually collapse
only to do it all over again
and again
and again
ininitely

there is no point to it
i strain myself looking for one

but does it 'FEEL' good? yes
is it 'FUN'? yes
that's really all i should hope for
is feel good and fun

does that justify violence? no
violence, etc murder, remove others (yours) ability to have fun
considering one of those people whose fun is removed
we can all agree to work together to rid ourselves of violence
FOR OURSELVES

but the goal is still just fun and pleasure
plain and simple
there is no point in even writing anything down
maybe to organize your thoughts
but once you get to this point
realizing it's all for nothing
and it will all be destroyed at the collapse
what is the point?
there is none
just live
enjoy
exist
and feel
while you can

STAND
UP
AND
DANCE

meh i can't dance
i really just want to code
and make music
with some shit dancing here and there
and trip balls
that sounds good
i can live with that
and then die


kaylee would be a bonus.
