True chaos, a fucking RNG, defies the laws of physics, therefore cannot exist. We have "chaos" that is subjective. To our tiny fucking puny ass human brains, the universe is full of chaos. However, it's really only "a PRNG with enough precision to produce life/etc".

I've read an itty bit of quantum mechanics and recall something about "each time it's (was it quark? idfk) observed it is unknown whether it will be A or B", or some shit. Presumably they've found a RNG... but I bet they're just not looking at the problem/evidence correctly. I don't claim to be an expert or even decent or even a fucking beginner at quantum anything (shit hurts my head), but
