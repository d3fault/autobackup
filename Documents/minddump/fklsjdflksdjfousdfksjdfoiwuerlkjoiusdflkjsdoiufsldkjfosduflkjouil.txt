That I am a duplicate is infinitely rare.
That I exist to begin with is infinitely rare.

So.... where does that leave me? Am I always original'ing or am I always repeating?
Both. Neither. Whatever you want to believe because it's not test-able sorry bro. It is not testable. Asking it repeatedly as you do is fucking pointless. There is no answer to it. So hmm you don't even need to flip a coin. Choose the one you like more (BECAUSE IT IS, OR HAS TO SOMETIMES, BE TRUE): I am originaling. There, I am. I am. I am original at least once, therefore this is that once. THAT is actually true (at least once) too. Indifferentiable replicas are all originaling simultaneously (even if repeating and not knowing it (so wrong really lol)).

Time is linear therefore there had to be a first SOMETIME.






The key to finding other existences (universes) is figuring out all the ways chemicals can interact with each other (we have 5 of them on our bodies fuck yeee), and then somehow programming them to pass messages to each other using each of those ways and to be able to inspect and figure out another existence. The answer MIGHT lay in sending out probes in outer space, but the "world" we "see" and "feel" is not all there is. We just have 5 senses available to us to view it, so that's all we perceive. Every type of chemical reaction with another is essentially a sense, so there are probably infinite(?). Wish I was a chemist so I could answer that better. So yea we need the chemicals to pass along messages in every "direction" (wat) and also be able to come back and say to us "yo we found something" in a way we can understand. Then it's just a matter of building a network link through those chemical reactions to the other realm/existence and attempting to communicate with it. Might not even be possible as the 'species' in that realm might not be evolved to that stage. And good fucking luck TRAVELLING there, I got nothing for that (science fiction bores me)...
