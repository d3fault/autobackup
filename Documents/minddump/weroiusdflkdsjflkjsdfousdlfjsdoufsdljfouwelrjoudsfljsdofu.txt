I'm almost certain, but just barely not certain enough to try, that the "going to sleep with a PRNG killing you 99/100 times (nitrous you, then squash your brain and chop it to thousands of pieces etc (NO CHANCE OF SURVIVAL [for the 99] IS IMPORTANT))" thing would work. It just makes perfect sense that it would work. I asked what it buys me? CONFIDENCE. Confidence in infinity and that in turns frees my will to be more bold/etc. It does have the huge downside of making your family/peers sad in 99/100 (99%) of the universes. So I want/wish/MAYBE-CAN-THROUGH-UNDERSTANDING-ALONE gain that confidence (as per the first sentence of this doc) and harness it without ever doing it.

I can't even give you an exact rationale, but it just seems to have "clicked" for me. I genuinely think it would work, and you probably don't even need a friend to do the PRNG scrambling (eh could be wrong on that part). I think there's enough unnoticed chaos to give the PRNG sufficient entropy. I doubt more that I could give the PRNG entropy than the entire experiment as a whole: give your friend the task of moving the mouse around randomly in a PRNG-seeder, just to be on the safe side, and it should be solved. But meh maybe it isn't. Guh there goes the confidence...
