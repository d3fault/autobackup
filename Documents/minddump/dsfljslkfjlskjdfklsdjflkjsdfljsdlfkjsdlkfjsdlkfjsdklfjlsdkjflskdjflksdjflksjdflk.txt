I originally thought these two pieces up at vastly different times. I'm talking months apart (but I kept forgetting to write the first bit).


The blowjob is a hack. It's possibly my favorite hack. A being emerged from chaos+time learns that it 'feels good man' to put his replication module into another being's resource aquisition recepticle. The penis is intended for a vagina, so putting it in a mouth is a 'clever exploitation of existing functionality to achieve some other goal(pleasure)'.


So part two requires a tad bit more explaination of part one: since the blowjob is a hack, it is not natural. Extrapolating: heterosexuals (who are generally homophobes) tend to make the argument that "homosexuality is not natural". Well there you have it: Blowjobs, even between a male and a female, are just as gay as same gender sexual intercourse.

So if you've ever made the argument that 'homosexuality is not natural', just remember how much of a faggot you are when you stick your dick in your gf/wife's mouf.



OT entirely: 'gay' will probably always be the most effective insult to the heterosexual. I have nothing against gays (and arguably am (but also arguably am not) one)), but I still acknowledge that fact.

OT entirely again: I think genders might merge back into one again in the future. There's really no need for two (but to quote an earlier writing by myself, it "isn't an evolutionary disadvantage" for there to be two genders.
