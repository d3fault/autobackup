I think I lost my train of thought.
My generation's dependency (infinity) is the same dependency needed for infinite multiverse theory where i do everything infinite times.

Somehow, somewhere, a RNG was created (or a PRNG that is simply "good enough" (provides enough precision)) and after a while, life was generated.


Since my generation has it's dependency (infinity) filled (although not by requirement, I can't detect patterns to indicate that other generations aren't also "random(chaos) + infinity"), one could interpret that dependency satisfaction to mean that the other one (infinite multiverse theory) certainly holds true too! Or perhaps "probably" if you prefer law speak.
