I speak the truth only for myself. I wouldn't feel a shred of guilt by lying to you, but being truthful is the only way I can retain my sanity.

I will lie about drugs only so I am not arrested/etc for them. I'll feel no guilt for that. And since I am admitting my lie ahead of time (far enough ahead of time that it won't be able to be linked with the lie itself (sup judges/jury/lawyerfags)), it isn't even a lie by my own standards.
