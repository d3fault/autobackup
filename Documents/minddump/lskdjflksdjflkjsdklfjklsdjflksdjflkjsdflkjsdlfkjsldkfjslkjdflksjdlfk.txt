MusicFingers can ultimately be a chip in the back of your neck (or wherever). Reading electrical impulses as they pass from your brain to your fingers (or other body parts) and feeding those values into a computer to synthesize music (or control a computer etc), the API is 1:1 to what I have it at right now (woot). There is also the concept of INPUTTING electrical impulses into that same chip. This is extremely dangerous and should be approached with extreme caution. Reading output is more or less safe (but it's equally as dangerous as "yea I could code a bomb in C++/Arduino" -- but not more than).... however INPUTTING electrical impulses gives one human the ability to control another. This is dangerous ethically/morally/etc.

However, even OUTPUTTING (capturing, reading, just like MusicFingers does now/today) electrical impulses is EXTREMELY dangerous when used 24/7/365. The best way to explain why is to have you watch the movie "Sphere". In it, Samuel L. Jackson's character "manifests his dream into reality". If one were to leave EVEN MUSICFINGERS (as it exists now/today) turned on during their sleep, their own subconscious dream could manifest itself into this here reality. When I was first starting to write this doc, I thought he vulnerability only applied to INPUT. However holy shit fuck me sideways this vulnerability is much larger than I thought (and I've tried to get myself to write this doc for weeks/months now). 

There needs to be a way to safely document/record/express one's subconscious dreams (using MusicFingers/chip/whatever). Basically another kind of "userland vs. kernel land" separation. If you are asleep, you can't do anything dangerous (but shit lol even if you're awake you shouldn't be able to do anything dangerous (but then you lack free will ;-P)).
