During my (first/last(as-in-most-recent;-P)) 1200mg DXM trip I had like 4 movies queued to start watching once I started tripping (never started them haha. ended up tripping off to army of mushroom and then of course the trip became the wire season 4), and I also turned off my monitor's power management and enabled the Galaxy screensaver to come on after 10 mins. I ended up interrupting it multiple times to use the light from my (non screensaver) monitor for writing (pen/paper), but I also recall just snapping out of it and looking at my monitor at various points. It wasn't a source of trippiness though; it was just kinda there. I knew what it was every time I looked at it (tempted to say it brought me comfort, but that wouldn't be entirely accurate (or maybe it did and I just forget))
