By refusing to mention proprietary content/materials-even (a specific hot sauce comes to mind), I too am censoring. For my own reasons and not to "protect the children"... but censoring nonetheless!!!!!



Ok solved. The problem is that with "all rights reserved" content, a condition for my being able to view/accept/experience it is that I MYSELF AM NOW CENSORED (from sharing that material). IT IS ILLEGAL TO DO SO! So I won't endorse products that censor their users, simple as that. We use censorship to fight censorship, which is an analogy (but actually intertwined very nicely so not just an analogy) to Copyleft using Copyright to fight Copyright! Wooooot! Or maybe I just mean "similar" instead of "analogy", idfk.
