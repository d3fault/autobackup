a few years ago, or perhaps even presently, i thought i was (am) losing my mind

i consider(ed) it to be a crucial step towards becoming an intelligent human

but now i think i get it better

one does not lose his mind
he just stops lying to himself that he knows what's going on

a lie created during the infant/child stage of life as a coping mechanism

"i know what's going on. this is going on"

what's "this" ?

"this is created by god" or <insert random bullshit here>




this is SOMETHING is all i'll say (/nobodyme)

i don't get it and i doubt i ever will

though i don't consider myself insane [anymore] (could be wrong)
