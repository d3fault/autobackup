What is it that when you throw a tennis ball against the floor and hte wall such that it meets the floor and the wall [seemingly] simultanously, it comes back at a greater speed than it would have come back otherwise. The big bang has the same effect, except it is at every angle (not just 2) and at (infinite?. at the very least... more than 2...) times more speed than that tennis ball gains from such a rare occurance.
