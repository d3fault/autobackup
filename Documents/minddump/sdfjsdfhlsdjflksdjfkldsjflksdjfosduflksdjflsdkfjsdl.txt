The "maintain 3 copies locally [networked together]" _AND_ "maintain 3 copies on a dht that i am a part of" is gameable (the dht [...]), but at least it's tons safer than nothing at all. under MOST circumstances, when the time comes for you to request your data, it is there.

right now we have nothing at all. I'll take something functional+insecure over nothing at all when it comes to attempting to improve the world's data survival rates. i know of way too many people who lose data all the time (or worse, they just delete it because they think they need to) because of operating system failures. every operating system is a piece of shit. backup solutions all need to be transparent, which means the backup solution needs to be integrated/designed into the operating system itself.

openbsd + qt, make compile on windows (linux implied but hell might as well leave it to someone else). compile only on windows, fuck testing (someone else will for me for free no doubt)



LATER ON, i should try to design/rewrite it securely. probably live-human-on-video-stream acking combined with crypto keys, as i've written hundreds of times before


for insecure version: NEVER trust the dht, kiss the ground and praise whatever god you believe in when you are forced to rely on the dht and your data is still there!


even the human live on video ("secure") version is gameable. it relies on the majority of it's participants to not lie during their acks.


what i was getting at was that the FUNCTIONAL backup solution (make it updateable too (don't lie about it and you're set)) should be MORE OR LESS an operating system [utilizing qt and it's deps for the heavy lifting]. there really aren't that many components to an operating system, and what you need (steve jobs understood this at least) is a flush and "1" and integrated and KISS and possibly even "themed" (or i guess you could just say re-use the user interface patters throughout (better TODOoptimization:abstract them(qt already does, what am i on about?))) solution. email (actually a messaging system (use alias/shortcut called email ALSO) that integrates text messaging/etc would be best), http-html-browser (the js prompt on first run should not be simply answerable via "yes" or "no". force them to be "insecure", and explain to them that most sites won't work without being in the "insecure" mode), office productivity suite compatible with you-know-whos (i don't think there's a liblibreoffice, at least not sure if it's license compatible if there even is one (*checks*)), notepad (this should be the first place you go when you click "write", but at the top should be a hideable-by-right-clicking button on the top toolbar, should be giant and green asking them if they want a full on productivity suite. in which case the preconfigured-to-default-to-microshit-format libreoffice is launched externally [or via lib embed if possible]. after they click it once, they are asked if they want to use the office productivity by default whenever "write" is clicked. the plaintext notepad is then only findeable as 'notepad', and this information is presented when the default is changed so the user can make a mental note in case they want to get back to notepad again (making notepad the default again is now in place of the thing asking about office, also hideable)), maybe some other bullshit like idfk a media player etc (optional whether or not this integrates with fingers/etc later), tools to pull data off of popular devices (phones, cameras, etc) would be handy, as well as a custom-device-wizard(pull-replicate-delete(optional-delete-btw(idk which to default to)) isn't that hard to genericize) for future proofing for any theoretical device released (that can be interfaced with [typically via usb, though anything really]), and lastly/as-a-bonus/but-perhaps-a-biggy: an app store. and of course whatever the fuck else i myself code, duh (though slightly off topic, i'm talking about the basics and not talking about targetting MYSELF [primarily] (though also am because i don't have a good backup solution myself (mine is manual/bleh)))

a hacky solution for using libreoffice externally would be to copy an empty file (ours, owned, resource of app) to a location and to have libreoffice autoconfigured to autosave somewhat frequrently. we do replicate temporarily those autosaves for fault tolerance, but only when they press the save button (they are told not to "save as" and that they can enter a title for it back in the app once leaving libreoffice) do we replicate it persistently. or hell the temporary ones can be persisted too since we want to "save backspaces" (at least in our notepad thing ;-P).... but ultimately tbh that means this solution sucks if i want to save backspaces, maybe the libreoffice sdk allows this but somehow i get the feeling it's just format import/export utilities. i think qt might have a drop in wysiwyg utility, which would easily serve as a base for and satisfy 99.999999999999999999% of your traditional "office productivity suite" users. cellular-spreadsheets would take some effort but eh there might be one somewhere on the net, they aren't THAT complex compared to their document/presentation software counterparts. hell none of them are THAT complex, but they are boring to me and time consuming. in fact a lot of this OS is...


OT: people want "no install" usage, but they don't realize they're already using an operating system installed on a computer. they (most) use what is given to them and have no fucking clue how to change it. only enthusiasts understand dialogs presented to them, most everybody else falls into one of two camps: click "yes" junkies and click "no" junkies. hell i'd even guess it might be around a 50/50 split between those two camps of junkies (with .000000001% of those users being enthusiasts who know the consequences of yes/no and make informed consent decisions (bill gates rapes grandmas)).

end of doc, now i know how to get back to here, just search for "bill gates rapes grandmas"

ok to elaborate on the joke: most users are not "of the intelligence level of consent"
