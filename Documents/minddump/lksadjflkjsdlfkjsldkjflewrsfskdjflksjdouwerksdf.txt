My mom walked in when I had d= open, holding their tablet with both front/back cams, derp asking me if it's okay to clean the sticky screen from Caydon. -_-. I instantly went from feeling fine and dandy (hell, even good) to being filled with rage: I want to kill everyone. Fuck this environment for indirectly not allowing me to express myself. My friend Tom from hs now works at google. I now can't honestly say I want to kill every google employee anymore (thought about posting this on his shitbook for lulz). Damn you Tom ;-P
