Since freedom is subjective/unclearly-defined/ambiguiouis/etc, those that I deem "evil" who would likely be attacking me should I try to bring freedom to the common man, are really just people who consider themselves "good" defending their own aquired "freedom". They would be the successful (or the stupid and brainwashed), so they'd have some reason to be against change. They might all in all lose. They care not about their fellow man.

I do wish to make the world free (how I see it), but I refuse to become a martyr in the process. Infinite multiverse theory about how I might not be able to die aside (whether it's true or not), I increase my chances of becoming a fucking vegetable as I attempt/achieve freedom for the common man. Being a vegetable is worse than prison or torture. Being a vegetable turns your brain into mush. You un-learn everything you ever knew over months/years. If I ever became/become a vegetable, I'd want to be frozen asap. Before my brain turned to mush. Who cares if it's "premature" and there might be a SMALL chance that I'd snap out of it in X months/years. It isn't worth the risk of mah brain turning to mush.

I don't know what to do with myself.
