I just got done skimming/LifeShaping my minddump folder and OH MY FUCKING ZEUS (had:yaKnow) I am way smarter than I give myself credit for. This stupid "minddump 0-24(5?): through insanity and beyond" book might seriously be enough to qualify as a one hit wonder and allow me to retire. I mean yea I'm going to do the video/launch at the same time as the book launch (minutes/seconds), but I can still look at the revenue and say "hmm yea I was right I could have retired off that money". But actually since I'm copyleft'ing the contents of it, the revenues will be way lower than if the book was proprietary. I'm ok with that though, so long as I am making $500/mo between book sales and internet stream ad revenue [and various entreprenual endeveurs to be erected while streaming].

Still idk it's just like a fucking great feeling I'm having. I think it's why I had that dream about the black thing clinging onto/through the OH-BTW shiny-ish leaf/Nature/EXISTENCE thing (I was like 60-70% done with the minddump folder before going to sleep last night (just finished now)). Like yea TONS of stupidity, but fucking gems here and there. Read it in reverse if you want to skip the stupidity (<-- PREAMBLE TEXT :-D).
