"I am willing to sacrifice my relationship with you if you aren't willing to not mention proprietary bullshit around me"
vs
"I'll be sad if you're not willing to not mention proprietary bullshit around me in order to maintain our relationship"

SAME FUCKING THINGS, but the latter keeps me from being painted as the "bad guy" (the destroyer of said relationship (but in all honesty, _I_ am asking _THEM_ to change xD (reminds me of curse words, except I have a valid argument (sanity) whereas curse words are just made up nonsense (censorship,control,domination,submission,proper))))

Presentation is everything, and is it considered 'acting'/etc to put thought into words when it comes to that in order to make them easier for others to chew/swallow? In all honesty, the first one was the original thought (I've been having this thought about switching it around (that particular statement especially)) and "more natural".
