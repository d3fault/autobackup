Just watched an old video of me playing with my glock and I held it to my head with it chambered. I was like flinching just watching it thinking I was going to shoot myself in the video. I would never do that again.

A lot of this old stuff has me really hesitant to release. I have even stated multiple times that I would not be releasing it. Obviously I've changed my mind and... I'm trying oh so hard not to censor ANYTHING... _BECAUSE_ I think the documentation from a -> b is of value > 0.

I've changed. This writing/documenting/coding/pouring-my-[poetic]heart-into-something has changed me. I have a much deeper appreciation for life than when I first started. I find it strange now, looking back, that I started this all as one giant suicide project (or at the very least, not to be released until after death). I was depressed and turned to ouputting/expressing because there was nothing else. It saved my life. It forged my life. (What's the difference?)
