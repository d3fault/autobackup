Do not allow anyone to show you an excerpt (or series of exerpts) of my writings and to use them to set your opinion of me. No statement can be taken on it's own, except this one.




Anyone can make me out to be a saint, a god, a hero, an idiot, a criminal, or a faggot.



Citing without context is a tool for the lawyers etc (who have no respect from the bulk of us).
