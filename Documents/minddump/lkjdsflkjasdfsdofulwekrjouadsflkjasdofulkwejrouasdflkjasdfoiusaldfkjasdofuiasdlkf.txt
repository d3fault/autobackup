Chaos punishes good. Chaos punishes bad. Chaos rewards good. Chaos rewards bad. Chaos does not differentiate the two. The only way for the emergence of life to "make it through" is for there to be infinite time. We are so very complex it makes me feel a bit sad for all the failed attempts (chaos punishing good) that suffered some form of torment (feel is real, even if we're talking about a different "bang instance").

Thought of this while playing hedgewars and thinking about how it's such a random ass fucking game. You can "do good" by killing a guy but it can backfire if it means he gets to one of his players with better weapons faster (since he doesn't use the now dead guy). Highlander mode.
