do not be ashamed for shame will eat you alive
disregard those who attempt to shame you
use your legs and walk in the opposite direction

you will find friends amongst others like you
whom you have not met (with exception to perhaps nick goulian) yet


/b/tards exist
i am a /b/tard
so i will be accepted by SOME

attempting to be accepted by ALL is irrational and stupid
you will piss many off
you will gross many out
you will... [who knows what. perhaps be 'banished' from your family. LOL like i give a fuck... (btw i doubt kaylee ever would. she has an open mind and that is one of the things that i love about her (though she might hold her tongue in my defense in order to keep from becoming 'banished' (LOL) herself (which if you really think about it is a character flaw (the very one i'm struggling with right now) that MIGHT be why she has rejected me (which leads me to believe/hope that maybe i can show her how to not care and might win her in the end (but we'll have less time left to spend together sadface (didn't want to do a real sadface because it's open parenthesis would completely fuck my head))))))]
