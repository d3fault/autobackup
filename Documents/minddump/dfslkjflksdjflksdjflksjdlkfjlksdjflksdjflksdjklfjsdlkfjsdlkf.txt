It is by will alone I set my BODY in motion.

^That's not even true, but it's more accurate than the Dune variant (mind and will are basically the same, bitches).

It is by chemical reaction, primitive genetic instinct (no consciousness whatsoever -- the only differentiation between this and chemical reaction is that this is passed along to offspring), fear (both primitive (animal level of consciousness) and intelligent), and finally will, that I set my body in motion.
