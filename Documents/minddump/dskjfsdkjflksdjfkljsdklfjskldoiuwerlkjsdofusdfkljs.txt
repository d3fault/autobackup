Choose:
a) Lifelong depression, chance of happiness (attaining bliss is questionable, since mind has rotted from the depression) post-frozing. Significant increase in chance of making it TO frozing.
b) 5 minutes of bliss, with obviously just more bliss post-frozing. Significant decrease in chance of making it TO frozing.

Both (a) and (b) share `roughly` ((b) has assassination concerns plaguing the frozing stage itself ALSO xD) the same chances for frozing working.

I choose (b), because I don't have enough confidence in frozing working to risk all my happiness on it.
