Art is all sex with no ejaculation. Science is all ejaculation with no sex. Arguably there are places where the two converge, but also arguably there aren't. I'm not sure which camp I'm in, but initially/impulsively I'd say the latter. I tried to think of a contradiction to it (tried to think of one place that they converge), and really/funnily (or perhaps because I'm just biased) the only one I could think of was me: the launch/etc. Art is to appeal to human emotion and to invoke thought etc, Science is to answer a question. Science can be used to make Art, and Art can inspire Science... but that doesn't necessarily mean one overlaps the other. What "actions" (things a person can do) are both inspiring and goal-oriented (was tempted to write "answers a question", except that my launch does not)? Hell there might be many, but my bias only lets me see my launch. The first two sentences are really the only cool part of this doc lol. mb i should combine them with a semicolon. I was staring at the Wikipedia for "Wireless power" yesterday and it was some "artist's rendition" of a satellite or something doing wireless power.. and I couldn't help but think how stupid it looked ("artistic"). I like the detailed/accurate approach (but I'm a coder so it's obvious why) more.




there's also a programming toolkit that tries to converge them. i forget what it's called. basically just a beefy graphics lib etc.
