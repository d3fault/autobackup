hmm what about the offline 'cert' + human password method? (concatenation)

eh it sucks that's what

if the offline 'cert' is compromised, they just have to brute force the human password
GONE.

fml

there really is no solution

when will this take effect?
100 years?
300?

not long, that's for sure (relative to evolution etc)

we're practically there

i might as well accept it
fuck passwords

and how do you secure certs then?

maybe you don't
maybe you shred the private key

and then just move onto a new keypair upon offline compromise??
