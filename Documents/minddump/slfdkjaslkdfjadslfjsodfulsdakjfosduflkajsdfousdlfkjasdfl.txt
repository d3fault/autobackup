Given existence, life, death, [and taxes] are guaranteed. Normally it is written that only death and taxes (had: life and death) are guaranteed. Life is, too. An existence with these laws of physics (I/we are unable to imagine any other), in addition to infinite time (infinite space/matter is not a requirement) = life ALWAYS emerges.

Taxes is in brackets because robotic communism does not have them. Fuck yea.
