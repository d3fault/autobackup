to elaborate on the thumb drive in the anus: it should be a keepass (password file) of all your passwords, NONE OF WHICH you should know. the "keyfile" is the password to the keepass password file, and that is unknown to you as well (and stored in your anus, retrieved only upon booting up your secure output-only system (which remains online i guess))
idfk there's lots to work out, and maybe other ways of securing it than your anus? still, it needs to be something where you KNOW you are physically "breached" ;-P. pickpockets are sneaky fucks, but i doubt they could get something out of your ass without you detecting it
