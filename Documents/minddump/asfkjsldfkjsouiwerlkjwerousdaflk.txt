when i get "dogFood"
i also get every appending of that "rootword" (tld sans extension?)
or is it an arbitrary word

pages linked to are not allowed to have targetting
the user has already been targetted
pages link to are to a specific product or brand (<- huge wording loophole fuck this idea)


but i mean i am still going to use "dogFood"
probably just abc-domain wide but idk i was kinda getting at that i should allow for sub-pages of a rootWord
