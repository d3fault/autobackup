I think by open sourcing ABC I will be doing a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge service to society and the world as a whole. ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWA. Fuck corporate news. "Download Your Own News Corporation". can those bitches really prevent me from using those two words in a row? I'm not referring to "news corp" specifically... but a corporation whose function it is to report news.


It's like calling yourself/your-company "Dildo Maker"

and then getting pissed (and sueing) when someone else starts selling (in my case, giving away :-P) machines and calling them Dildo Makers. It's fucking bullshit.
