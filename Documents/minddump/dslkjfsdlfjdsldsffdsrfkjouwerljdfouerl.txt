It is impossible to not be judged or to not judge. The only way you can COUNTER a "judger" is by judging them back (as being a judger). Doing so doesn't necessarily mean that you're over the "judging too fucking much" line (that the person you are judging is clearly over), only that you are judging as opposed to not judging at all.

Every human interaction has judging qualties to it, unless both the person's conscience and subconscience are not aware of the other person's presence (though this isn't a requirement, you can judge a person just by thinking about them). Being in the same room as another person, your subconscience modifies your behavior in subtle ways. Being in a room full of people means you modify yourself for each and every one of them, until you are a mush of flesh on the couch doing absolutely nothing.

I prefer 1on1 communication.
