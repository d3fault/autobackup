i have a crush on another human which society deems unacceptable
some will be for it, but the majority of my peers will judge me for it
i want to procreate with this being, but science tells me i cannot
even without, i want this person as my companion
their love flourishes for all to see, and together we would have an indestructable bond
a bond that lasts a lifetime; that transcends marriage, procreation, race, religion, and all the evils of the world

lol this is getting cheesy as fuck and i'm too much of a pussy to post it on facebook anyways...
...this was written intentionally playing the pronoun game to make it look as if i had a crush on another male
when in reality, it's about kaylee :-p
it would be fun to post it and to even troll her into posting a reply to it
"follow your dreams steven, i support you" or something similar/cheesy as fuck (she often combines serious with cheesy/funny/what-am-i-even-saying/explaining-idfk)
then that night i could call her up and be like "yo let's chill nigga" and then we'd have sex
ok probably not but then i could put my dick in her butt
ok sorry i just can't take this seriously anymore because i figure if she did agree to be my companion i'd probably end up showing this to her so i can't help but troll because that's what i do. ima fucken troll. hello slut.
i can't get you off my mind it's an unhealthy obsession. i need to just go for it so i can take the rejection. i'm not even afraid of the rejection...
...but i kinda am afraid that she'd tell her family what i've done/asked. something i COULD deal with if she said yes (supposedly. it would still be difficult but it would be difficult for her too... and in all honesty i bet she'd get more shit for it than me lol. sux4u being a girl and all(the girl is the one that's supposed to say no, according to old fashioned tradition bullshit(which my(our) grandma would invoke)))
that sentence is so beautifully written i really need/want to do something with tangentify
