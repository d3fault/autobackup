I think it's stupid that advertising space is a tangible/sellable good
But I am staring straight into the heart of reality (Google (the reality of who owns the most of the internet)) and I see that it is
I accept it as fact
And am harnessing it?
While all the time laughing at it


Politicians are priveleged in that everything they say is in the public domain
I can't logically be in LIBRE-mode and be a politician
logic error FAIL
on whose part?
should i change that?
or should i change TO it?
no, changing to libre is best (in terms of convincing anybody in a "sales pitch" (lol wut? i am gratis))
because it protects the content from the very copyright system that "takes advantage of" (in the bad way) public domain content
if no copyright content "law" exists, then everything said is in public domain
this is how it should be
threats should be punishable
we need a binary threat detection scheme
it either is or it isn't
and it's peer reviewed
it might be impossible
