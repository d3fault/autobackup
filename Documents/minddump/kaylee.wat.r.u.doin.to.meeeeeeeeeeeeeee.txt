the past two times i've seen kaileyy (wtf), i have been wanting to ask her out. had a video recorder in pocket and wanted opportunity alone with her to ask
the first time, i bitched out
the second time, she asked ME out
i think i jumped on it too fast, but that's besides the point
we're going hiking
i keep getting lost thinking about what i want to say to her
i love her?
i want to be with her?

i'm kinda bitching out but also remaining closetted by probably saying "i love you as a person, and really do wish we could  [.....]" i forget the rest
been meaning to write this for a few days now, the second time was caydon's birthday
oh and also, she said i am on her "to-do list"
i came
her "task at hand" (self-redirected to be ME) was pouring a drink so she kept repeating herself asking me if i wanted to go hiking
maybe my brain was just in doubt of hearing it correctly?
