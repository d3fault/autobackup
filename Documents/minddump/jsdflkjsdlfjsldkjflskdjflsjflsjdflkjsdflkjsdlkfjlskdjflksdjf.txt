Business and emotion condradict each other (an emotional business man fails at business). A human without emotion is a robot. So our artificial selection is now breeding robots. What the fuck do we expect from the human species? I mean seriously, what the fuck is our goal? As far as I know, there is no goal. Back in the 60s and shit our goal was to reach the moon. Well we did that and aside from a show of cock size it didn't really accomplish very much. But now what? Profit is our master. Mars is a loose goal we might accomplish within the next thousand years "if it's profitable" (my brother told me about some mission where a guy would film it and the whole thing would be financed by ad-revenue/etc (yea I'll admit I thought he was trolling me at the time (maybe he was))).

The richest people necessarily (aka "by definition") are completely focused on money [and nothing else]. If they aren't focused on money, they aren't the richest. The richest poeple have the most influence (money IS influence). So what the fuck, a bunch of robots chasing money are driving the world. Seriously ok back up and think about it: what IS the goal of the human species? Don't know of one (other than profit)? That's because there is none (other than profit). Mars (replication/backup), world hunger, resource consumption minimization, and stepping out of a pointless endless cycle of school-work-work-work-work-work-work-die.... SHOULD be our goals. But yea, we fucking have none (except profit (which is really just kinda a chaotic pursuit of stupidity (with some few benefits here and there (admittedly, all existing technology (that I love) is the result of that pursuit)))).

I'm so fucking tired of being a complainer but I'm also fucking tired of existing in this stupid fucking society.
