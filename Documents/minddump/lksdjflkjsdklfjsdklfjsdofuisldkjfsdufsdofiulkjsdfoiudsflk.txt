Monday night should become my drinking night. I can and would proceed forward with coding right now (actually kinda iffy since that bitcoin pseudocode needs easily a FULL FUCKING DAY to implement (and needs to be one sitting)), or perhaps even tomorrow after waking up right when I wake up........ BUT Caydon's coming at like 2-3pm tomorrow so no coding tomorrow. I guess err the argument is weak except when I have a huuuuge task to implement but actually I'm just confused now and stopped caring.

tl;dr: can't begin impl until Wednesday morning -_-
