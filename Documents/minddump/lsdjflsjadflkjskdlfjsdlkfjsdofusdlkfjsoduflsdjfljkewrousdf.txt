The db in Abc2 is going to be so infrequently used that it's unlikely to be the point of failure. If I didn't have GetAndSubscribe, that wouldn't be true. Since I have GetAndSubscribe, the Wt nodes (different machine) are the most likely points of failure (excluding of course random hdd/psu failures, which have nothing to do with the kinds of fails I'm talking about here: system overloads/whatever-bugs)... AND that's real fucking neato because Abc2 is coded to handle Wt node failures at any point in time and to be able to recover from all of them. Redundant power supplies exist, as do raid hdd setups, so maybe with a bit of luck (xD) I won't lose any/much database 'stuff'. I'm unsure if I should even use replication at this point, but leaning towards yes (certain fails in db stuff will be equivalent to wt node fails and will be recoverable, but some will not and will fuck shit up hardcore). Replication raises load and therefore increases chances OF failure, but when that failure happens auto-failover kicks in and..... maybe the system stays alive? But back to the original point: there's not going to be very much db access to begin with. I have over-engineered it once again.
