the benefits of capitalism is a logarithmic function

really really really fucking beneficial right away
but levels out

we have levelled out

patents/copyright/capitalism is now hindering progress

bootstrap from the bump it provided in free/libre cultre/society (which might require a type of 'cube grid')


also addendum to earlier: a cube grid can be devised, population limits can be enforced, but i want society as a whole to vote upon the issues (and creating said software is my mission). majority rules (this is called ANARCHY, which has a bad rap :-P... so choose a different name just to appeal to the average idiot) decides and forms cube grid however it pleases.

right now we have minor corporate groups (with majority of the money) making all the decisions. it is bound to lead to disaster (or already has, depending on who you ask)
