Movies, games, and operating systems... literally take lifetimes to create. 1 year (average product development length that I pulled out of my freshly shaven ass) of 100 people working 40 hours a week is the same as 1 person working 40 hours a week for 100 years (100 years being a high duration of life given medicine on earth in 2014).

OT-as-fuck: I'd bet the quality of the product that the 1 person working 40 hours a week for 100 years would make would shit all over the 100 peoples' working 40 hours a week's product. Why? passion and "tribal knowledge". 100 people know 1/100th of the product, whereas 1 person knows 100% of it.
