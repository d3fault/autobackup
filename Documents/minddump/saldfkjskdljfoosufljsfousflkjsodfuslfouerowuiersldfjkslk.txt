I'm glad I went for the girl even though it resulted in rejection (now listening to 'PDF Format - God Only Knows' (and i _DO_ know, because i am without)). It's allowing me to live without the regret of it in this admittedly crazier universe.

1) Go for the girl because love is better than any drug/power/pleasure/etc
2) If rejected, well... do whatever, but without the regret of not going for the girl :)
