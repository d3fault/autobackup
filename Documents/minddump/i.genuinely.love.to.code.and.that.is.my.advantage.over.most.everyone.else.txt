i just learned something / figured something out

my biggest advantage (over google, was what i was thinking initially)

I
LOVE
TO
CODE

that isn't something someone can overhear (i said it out loud in my kitchen, including this sentence (though not either of these parenthesis)) and force themselves to do
nobody can force themselves to love coding
it's natural

and i genuinely mean it when i say it

I
FUCKING
LOVE
TO
CODE
AND
IT'S
ONLY
GOING
TO
GET
BETTER
AND
EASIER
AND
MORE
FUN
AND
I
WILL
ONLY
LOVE
IT
MORE
I
CAN'T
WAIT
TO
LAUNCH
IT
IS
DESTINY
lol jk i don't believe in destiny

but i will say:
it is without a doubt the smartest way i could ever choose to live my life
i will get the most out of life
i'll cross my fingers and hope love works itself out
you gotta go searching too
(btw: launching puts you in front of infinite more people. because 0 times infinity is still 0. but lots, perhaps millions more)

but i mean
as far as something to DO
to give my life meaning

there is none so i am creating some
i am allowed to do that as a conscious being
there are no rules
we make the rules
that is my rule
my rule is to have fun and enjoy life because it will be over sooner than you expect (as per old people reports and my own observations)

and for me, fun IS coding
different than most, fine
who gives a shit?

they might like it if
a) they were smart enough to do it
b) they learned it

b and a have nothing to do with each other
