Turns out the reason it crashed was because I was trying to copy root files/folders as a user. Since I can't login as root or use sudo, I was unable to test that it works. I also found out through testing that if you copy the debug build to another folder (lol i ran the app on it's own tree numerous times) that it segfaults... whereas if you do the same with the release build it works fine. And weirdly if you run the debug build with gdb then it doesn't segfault.

Additionally, I took that implicitly shared QDir related line out just to see whether I was right or wrong. Seems I was right! I didn't test the cdUp solution but that probably would have worked too. Blah need to get on with this static backup because time is not on my side today (especially considering my lack of sleep (which makes me worry a bit on top of it all!))
