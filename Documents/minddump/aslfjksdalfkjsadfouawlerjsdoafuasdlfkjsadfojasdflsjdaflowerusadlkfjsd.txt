I just sent a ridiculously long email to Kaylee last night...
... and I just went to facebook with a mission: see if she re-enabled her account


like, I don't even know how to explain in words what it means if she does
but it definitely means something
"what is he up to" or something


BUT SHE DID
it was NOT enabled yesterday (i'm PRETTY damn sure)
it IS enabled now


fuuuuuuck yea

it means something, i'm just not sure what :-D



<3 facebook's policy on not rapidly enabling/disabling your account!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
never thought i would ever say "<3 facebook" in a sentence... lmfao.


this just got my adrenaline/confidence pumping again :-P



also, I know she'll love that yoshi's island remix i posted today :-P
