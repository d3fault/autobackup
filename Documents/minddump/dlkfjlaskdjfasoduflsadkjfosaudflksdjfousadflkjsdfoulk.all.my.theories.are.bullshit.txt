So yea I was wrong to say that a RNG defies the laws of physics... because we don't defy the laws of physics! What I meant to say: a PRNG cannot occur natura- osidufosdjflk we occur naturally. What I mean to say is that an RNG is dependent on consciousness. It's a mistake to say that consciousness depends on a RNG (I could be wrong here).
