I picture existence as a giant mesh of chemicals... rocks/whatever... and there's like a carving in the top-right corner of it that's chaotic in nature. In the carvings there's like "pointy"-ness at some parts of the individual rocks (err, just when you zoom in more, hard to explain). At the very tip of some of the pointy shits, the tip is "lit up"... representing life (consciousness (self awareness)).
