cognitive dissonance
that was shame talking
'other perspectives exist'

I CAN'T PROVE IT
i get a choice with how to live
shame tells me to acknowledge other perspectives
and, i quote myself, 'act accordingly'

FUCK EVERYBODY
do whatever YOU feel is right
live however YOU want to live
even if it is completely unheard of
you program your brain when you are born
we have pre-bootstrap software installed

i need to disconnect/disassociate
and create my own

the cool thing is, they can mimic me by simply watching me. there is no source code that needs to be shared
fuck shame.
fuck paranoia.
i contradict myself.
all the fucking time...

i think therefore i am
i am uncertain i exist (though i am quite implicitly certain)
and i am uncertain that others exist (way less certain)


don't act accordingly
i mean do in terms of security

but doesn't that also count?
for paranoia
fml.
idk wtf to do

i see both sides to it

i guess i can just stand right where i am and spin in circles as fast as humanly possible
both?
neither?
exactly.
