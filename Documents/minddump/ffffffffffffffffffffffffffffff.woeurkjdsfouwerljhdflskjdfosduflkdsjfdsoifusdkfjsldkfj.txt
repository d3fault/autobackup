I love her and want to crush myself. Want to squeeze myself out of existence. In a fetal ball of depression. I suck at imagery. Fuck fiction, this is legit. She is real. As real as me. If only I could fall from outer space infinitely and hold her, knowing we're both upside-down plummetting toward death, push her away from her instinctive cling, tell her to snap the fuck out of it, stare at her in the eyes.... and provide her the same comfort she'd provide me. We hug CALMLY now, and then die.


Yea lego movie (sucked btw), and also:
We are about as in control as a person (had:man) sky diving without a parachute. We can turn a bit and we can make ourselves more/less aerodynamic, but in the end we all go splat.
