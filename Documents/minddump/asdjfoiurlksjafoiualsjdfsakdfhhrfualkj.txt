do the pros of being alive outweigh the giant con of death?
and the answer is irrelevant because you must first be alive before you can even analyze the question

actually, not necessarily
because just analyzing the pro (implying that the 'analyzing' IS a pro) does not by default mean that it outweighs death


but completely aside and my opinion only. should be the d3fault opinion. as in my personal default. what i would think would be your default/opinion too (but i can be wrong):
yes.
