If free will exists, then a RNG exists (consciousness). Purely chemically/physically, a RNG cannot exist as it defies the laws of phsyics. But a self aware, conscious, in control "free will" is by definition a RNG that merely "steers" the PRNG that contains it. We do not defy the laws of physics, but we are beyond mere chemical reaction.

Of course we might be just deluding ourselves that we're in control, but if that's the case than I prefer delusion as it makes me happy. So continuing...

Our actions from thought can be random, though they often are not. We are (and I am at this very moment (feelsgoodman)) floating in a cloud of PRNG. A PRNG with sufficient complexity and time to form (codewise) a true RNG: consciousness. I can't define consciousness logically (codewise) except that it can probably only ever occur (though this certainly isn't true (SCIENCE BITCHES)!) from chemical bombardment of sensory input over billions of years; that and the fact that the "alternate universes" where consciousness did NOT emerge from such chemical bombardment, never knew they didn't.


I say free will is an RNG because if it was a PRNG, then it wouldn't be free will. It would be deterministic. So it's effectively ONLY deductive reasoning that makes me say free will is RNG.

(AGAIN: WE MIGHT NOT HAVE FREE WILL AND MIGHT JUST BE PRNG DELUDING ITSELF <3)

1) Free Will, RNG
2) Delusional Free Will, PRNG

Just like a bool can only ever be true or false, we are DEFINITELY one of those two.


Testing/proving which we are relates to and is probably as difficult as figuring out where this 'existence' thing came from...


I'll take either one, because what seems real, is.
