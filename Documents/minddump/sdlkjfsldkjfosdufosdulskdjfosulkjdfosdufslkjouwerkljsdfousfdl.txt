My primary "thing" will be coding, but my secondary "hobbies" over the next decades should be: Music/Chemistry/Physics. I can of course remove/add items at will, but those are the things I WANT to learn. They fascinate me... physics the least of which (blah too much hard/pure math... though it's the math that explains everything so IT SEEMS WORTH LEARNING HAHAHA (i have never taken a physics class so maybe i'll hate it? who cares can modify the list at will!)).


I wonder what my trips will be like after I have learned all 4 of them to a bachelors degree level (or when content). I wonder but only draw a blank. Receiving the question mark response intrigues me even further. My understanding can be even clearer (it already seems so clear using only my logic/codan skillz)?!?!?!?!?!?
