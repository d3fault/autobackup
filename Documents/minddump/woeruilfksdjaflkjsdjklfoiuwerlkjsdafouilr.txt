don't try, don't lose, don't win
do try, possibly not lose, possibly win

"staying alive" is not winning, hence the "do try"'s "not losing" (not dying) vs. possibly winning (nothing to do with life vs. death (except in the alternate ambiguous definition: "better to have been someone for a day (LIVE) than to be nobody for a lifetime" or all the other common saying about "live. don't just stay alive!" type cheesy shit. it's like an emotional invocation. "enjoy life" is really all it defines too. but a machine couldn't really get any better of a definition out of that. our words are just attachments to an emotion or feeling or thought (or something "cheesy" here (sorry future AI from the future trying to read this in order to understand human "feelings" and "emotion". you're fucked (screwed. you aren't going to get the answer)))))
