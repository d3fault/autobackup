I should mention that I bought some "head rush" spice today. Previously I had only purchased "fly high", though it's been a long while since I've purchased any drugs tbh. The head rush spice is MOSTLY similar to fly high, but I feel as though I've learned a new trick with the drug. It is very likely only just my state of mind that has done it. I disassociate standing. Sensory deprivation because I am a light motherfucker. Laying down doesn't work because I feel the bed. I want/need an isolation chamber.


Another off-topic thing: Montaigne talks about in his "On Solitude" chapter about how a man who can go with losing all his possessions has not really lost anything at all (so long as his brain is properly organized). I am almost there and I can and will be there once I am public. I need to broadcast onto the internet in order to be in the state where "nothing can be taken away from me". Right now I have a huge investment in "this data" (minddump). It is a weight on my conscience.



I am now going to go back outside to smoke yet another bowl (4th today woot) and to try standing with music blasting and this computer on and ready to type. In the future I will not have to open my eyes and walk over to this monitor in order to start, but I'm just making do with what I have right now/tonight. I will stand there and disassociate until I think of something interesting and worthwhile. My main concern is falling over: to remedy this, I will stand more than one body length away from my computer so that if I do fall, I only hurt myself and not my computer. I'm afraid of hard drive failure from being "knocked", more than me hitting my temple and dying etc. Still, I think my feet will sense the movement (and so should my ears?) and I will know as I fall, open my eyes and correct/catch myself. This of course assuming the drugs don't make my ears fail to function and my feet fail to sense the ground below them.
