Robinson asked me if I'd rather live here or in the shire. Told him my answer depend on whether or not there'd be magic/etc in the shire. After thinking about it more, I'm changing my mind. Magic indicates undefined/unpredictable/unstable laws of physics, so it would probably lead to insanity/etc. There would probably not be code/internets/etc.
