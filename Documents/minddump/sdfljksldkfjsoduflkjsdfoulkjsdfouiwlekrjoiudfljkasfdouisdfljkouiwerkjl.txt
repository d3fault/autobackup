There's no such thing as nothing (except conceptually)

When you sit and do nothing your body is on auto-pilot and still doing shit tons.

Show me a vacuum claiming it's "nothing" and I'll show you vacuum-x-length by vacuum-y-length of... space? even if there's no oxygen/whatever-atoms IN the vacuum, the vacuum still takes up... space (idk what the proper wording is)?
