Everything is pointless.


...which is kind of liberating...
we aren't bound to some stupid objective
we get to make it up however we please



if you spend your life searching for purpose, you will find none and be disappointed and waste your life away
but if, hopefully while you're young, you realize there is no purpose...
... it frees up your mind onto making up random [hopefully-amusing] activities of your choosing
