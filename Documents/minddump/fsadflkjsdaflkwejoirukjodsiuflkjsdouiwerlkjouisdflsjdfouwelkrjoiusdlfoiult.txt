Yesterday was interesting. Didn't expect to figure out our political system and it's stupidity like that. Quite proud of it, even though I don't really give a shit about politics.

Am I obliged/destined to lead the change to robots and freedom? Won't it guarantee my death? WON'T I DIE ANYWAYS BECAUSE I'LL BE CODING THE UNDERLYING TECHNICALS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT I AM FORMALLY POLITIC? Fuck. I see my own death now.


Easy. Some fucking capitalist that doesn't want to give up his money (and the concept of it) will kill me dead. It isn't hard to kill someone. I am not safe anywhere on this planet. I am not safe anywhere in this universe.


So I guess just enjoy it while you're here. You already know you have to die eventually.... but not you're quite certain your death will come from assassination from capitalists. Damnit, significantly shorter lifespan.



Conservative Republican and Liberal Democrat have NOTHING to do with each other. They are not "left" vs. "right" as the media so nicely packages it for us. Definitely wouldn't be surprised if other intelligent people have realized the shit I wrote yesterday... but surprised I haven't read about it anywhere (then again, I don't read).





I will readily admit that MAYBE conservative republican capitalism is needed to save the day from our eventual resource depletion... but I will also readily admit that DEFINITELY 'conservative' republican capitalism will also be the cause.

Robotic freedom only slows things down and buys us more time, it doesn't solve the problem. But really slowing down helps... AND I am willing to be (my life!) that other humans will solve it (for their own sake!)... if not at the very least "because it's interesting to them".


Meh I don't like this document at all.
