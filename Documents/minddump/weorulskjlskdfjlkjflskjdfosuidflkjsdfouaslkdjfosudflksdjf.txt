Wouldn't AI, if created (coded), spend the first N years of it's existence studying itself and trying to replicate itself in code?

Maybe that's exactly what we are an infinite series of? AI coding itself... but somewhere in between losing communication abilities with the AI it has created.

It makes sense for the very reason we (AI) are trying to code AI. The AI we create will try to create AI which will try to create AI which will try to create AI ...

So I guess the solution is to just say "fuck yea I am AI I don't care how I function"... but meh I actually very much do and others do too!

Our ad hoc AI solutions will be very beneficial but I don't think we'll ever get close to making true AI. We aren't patient enough to let infinity/natural-selection shape the AI, so our attempt at true AI will just be a series of hacks that, in the end, makes the true AI nothing more than a giant fucking hack. Sure maybe useful/functional/etc, but nowhere near as intelligent and yada as we are.
