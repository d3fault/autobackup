I have been tempting myself lately
or not tempting, but testing/trying
I have been trying to find my "darkest" thought
I guess I'm looking for a limit to what I will write
I didn't even know there was a limit
but I have found it

I mean maybe it's not the case and I'm just becoming more fucked up.
Maybe more fucked up and just don't have the courage/willpower to write all of that part down?
Maybe I _want_ it to exist only in my brain for now? I mean that would be a tactical advantage definitely.
all of the sudden I'm using periods xD YOU ARE A FUCKING MORON D3FAULT/STEVEN you know that?

d3faultsteven should be my name, just like that old aim. perhaps on the d3fault.[com/net/org] domain?
