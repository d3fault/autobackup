I genuinely feel I'm going to be giving the world way more than 10k in value. I and (then) others will look back on that/this-fail-fundraising and lol. I already am lolling, but nobody is lolling with me and I also haven't yet made the statement true (although honestly the decryption keys more or less make it true (but my actions following the publicizing of my decryption key make it true by much more)).
