Since there's a growing number of (had:so many new) laws that are based on the [subjective] opionion of a "reasonable" person, why don't we just save ourselves a lot of trouble and erase every law, replacing them with just one: it is against the law to break the law.


Or even: You must be a reasonable person, or else we will lock your ass up.


Hmm shouldn't all religious people be locked up then? (the answer is no because, even though they are stupid and unreasonable, they are the majority and the court doesn't ask what's GENUINELY reasonable (ITT:Logic), but what the average-given-the-population considers reasonable -_-)
