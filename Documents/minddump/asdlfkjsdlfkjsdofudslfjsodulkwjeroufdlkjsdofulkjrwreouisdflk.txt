I have the capability to hire out my programming but then i lose creative control because i never see all of the software api in great detail and then never get amazing ideas of things to do with it. only coders truly create. you can learn to code and then come up with ideas and then pay people to make them... or even learn computers and come up with an idea and then pay someone to do it (but your options are far more limited at this point.
you can create by paying people to implement ideas/designs (or your designs can equal code implementations >_<)
