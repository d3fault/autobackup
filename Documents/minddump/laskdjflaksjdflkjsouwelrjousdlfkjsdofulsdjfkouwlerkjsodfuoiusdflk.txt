If I was to take an extremist approach and kill politicians/CEOs in an attempt to shut down the patent system (perhaps leaving a note saying "shut it down and these killings will stop"), it wouldn't work because whenever I'd kill someone, another would pop right up to take his place. It's similar (had:akin (never used that word b4)) to the war on drugs.
If I was to take an extremist approach and pursuade politicians/CEOs in an attempt to shut down the patent system, it wouldn't work because each person who was successfully pursuaded would be killed and replaced (by "them").

A broken arbitrary system that gives it's users very real power is much more difficult to shut down than it is to erect.

Semi-OT: patents were maybe a good idea hundreds/thousands of years ago when ideas/"inventions" were rare and progress was moving slowly. These days, patents hinder progress. They do the opposite of their intended effect.
