I will have a passive influence on law. I will suggest changes but I don't dedicate all my time to actively promoting them and making them known and yada yada. Politics is boring and I won't wait up for it or dedicate my mind to it. I of course reserve the right to reverse that and become politically active if I so choose. I doubt RMS knew he'd be mostly doing advocacy back in the day. He too started out as a coder.
