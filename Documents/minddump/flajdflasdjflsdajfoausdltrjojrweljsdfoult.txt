I'm going to try to get my name changed. Why? for fun, for lulz, for committment, for devotion. I am d3fault. I don't want a middle or last name. Just d3fault.


I'm going to see if I can get the $300 bullshit fee waived/reduced/deferred, using the rationale/argument (which is true, though doesn't bother me nearly as hard as I will press it): my father and I are constantly opening each other's confidential mail... so in the interest of complying with the law (or some bullshit along these lines :-P), I am requesting a name change. And then I give them the sob story about how I'm broke yada yada or whatever. Might work, who knows. I don't know why I'm writing this though since I think I'll record the conversation.

I am paranoid of some corporation targetting the name and setting up a business with the name and then trying to forcefully ($1000/each) taking the name. I have seen the legal text, and names have legal precedence. Mike Row Soft. LMFAO. At present there is no-one interested (some random blogger at d3fault.blogspot.com is a coder... and I think he might even be impersonating me... though I don't give a shit [for now]), but it will help me sleep at night knowing that giant corporations COULDN'T if they wanted to. LLC would work too but eh I have written previously about not wanting d3fault to be a corporation. ABC maybe... or any other 'businesses' I create.... but d3fault: nope.


Music motivates me. Current song is saying "my eyes are on you -- be sincere"

Is the illuminati real?


I see random phrases and distinct words showing up in media I watch (just a few shows and lots of movies).

I am just a paranoid fuck probably.

meh.


launching solves this.
old problems that are still current are old.
