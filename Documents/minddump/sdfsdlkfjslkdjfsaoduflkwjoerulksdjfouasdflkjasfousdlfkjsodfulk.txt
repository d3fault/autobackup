Ride your emotion. It will take you under and you will feel as though you are drowning. Fear not. Release. Give up. You will die and you will live. To fight is to surrender. Understanding is the key to it all. Remember that even though it takes you under and thrashes your body against the coral reef, it also brings you ...... ridiculously....... high at times. Those waves that double (triple, etc) up on each other. You can ride one. It is not impossible. It breaks no laws of physics.


There are two ways to lose:
1) Do not try
2) Try and fail

There is one way to win:
1) Try and succeed


When trying your skill is certain factored in, but I would argue that > 50% of it is luck (chaos). I might be wrong and it is [probably] indeterminable, but regardless of that fact: through deductive reasoning there is but one answer: try and do not fear the results.
