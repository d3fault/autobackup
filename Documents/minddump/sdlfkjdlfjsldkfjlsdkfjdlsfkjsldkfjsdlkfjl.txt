While waiting for a thunderstorm to end underneath the bridge at pebble beach, I saw a lightning bolt strike the water and the sounds it made were amazing. So let's say I'm standing under the bridge next to the water, facing the water (and the same direction as the underside of the bridge). The lightning struck off to the left, maybe 20-30 ft from the side of the bridge and more or less in the middle of the river. All in all maybe 300 ft from where I'm standing. Just like in the sky, there was no sound at first. The sound came at me and bounced off the wall behind me, then went across the river and bounced off that mirroring wall on the other side, then raced off into the distance. The 3 of those sounded like this: "ping, ping, voooooooooooooooooom", with the voom sound fading off into the distance. Took me a minute or two to figure out what the fuck just happened. Wish I had it recorded fml fuck this era.
