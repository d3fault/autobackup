The world is metaphorically correct. I'm a coder and a computer etc, but additionally and pathetically the role of my father makes sense too: I am unable to speak, he dominates the household (I wouldn't mind so much if he wasn't such a negative nancy). Stand up to him or leave, it makes no difference, but my point is that he fits metaphorically with the world as a whole. The problem most of us face is being ourselves. Peer pressure is fucking stupid and has such a huge chaotic effect on all of us. Be yourself yea, and a requirement of that is not being afraid of looking stupid. I'm trapped in my brain and it's easy for me to blame my father. Similarly, a recently emerged life form struggles to understand and sift it's environment. This doc sounded much better when I first thought it up a few days ago... and I was babysitting caydon so didn't/couldn't go write it.

And since the words aren't coming out right, segue into repeating myself: my failure is a series of small as fuck distractions, not any one big thing (well I am also a pussy there is also that). a dog barks.
