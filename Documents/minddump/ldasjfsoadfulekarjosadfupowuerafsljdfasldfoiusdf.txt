i want both
i want both to be known
and to be unknown


actually, before i started writing this (been in my brain for a while)
i thought i had to choose between the two
that's what fronts are all about noob

you want both?
then do both.


still unsure about how i want to do ad agency..
might as well do it legit though... no laws broken

ABC even

but shit sucks
centralized/profit money machine
d3fault will be superior in every way
may even introduce it's own crypto currency~
hash of chain of FILES (global) + transactions + the specified amount of leading zeros = currency
idfk
better than a waste
but might not be efficient/able
who knows





i still also kinda want to be purely unknown
but then it's hard to make up a cover story
fuck it
