Grandma/Grandpa (Tobey. haven't tried to persuade Wieler yet):

a)
If:
I am right and you are right (Future technology can unfreeze/revive and God does exist)
Then:
You get to live longer on earth. Heaven isn't going anywhere.

b)
If:
I am wrong and you are right (Freezing/reviving procedure fails and God does exist)
Then:
You live the same length of time as before. When you die, you go to heaven as usual.

c)
If:
I am right and you are wrong (Future technology can unfreeze/revive and God does not exist)
Then:
You get to live longer on earth. When you die (if*** you die from an accident), nothing happens.

d)
If:
I am wrong and you are wrong (Freezing/reviving procedure fails and God does not exist)
Then:
You live the same length of time as before. When you die, nothing happens.
