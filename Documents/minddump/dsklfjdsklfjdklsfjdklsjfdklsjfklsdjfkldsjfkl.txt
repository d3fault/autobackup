I'm afraid to use Qt Creator's "Rename Symbol" functionality on methods/signals/slots, because it sometimes fails to rename their occurance in the Qt4-style connect statements. And invalid signal/slot names is only a runtime error. Sure, I could use Qt5-style connect syntax, but then I lose a couple of features, most importantly signal/slot "pure virtual interfaces". d=i will solve this problem/fear, since it's a code generator and it simply regenerates (instead of trying to parse/modify) the Qt4-style connect statementsl
