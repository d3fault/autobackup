My life is changing drastically, but I love it because I am the one invoking the changes. Soon I will be able to walk around outside with all my data on my persons (might as well make my bulky pockets worth it :-P). It will bring me peace of mind. This is a tiny example of how my life is changing, just one that is relevant/soon. Ultimately, I'll become a fucking cyborg (will always be mostly human). I'll code and build it all myself, for lulz and entertainment (nothing else to do). A musical cyborg btw :). I am pumped.

The point of this document is eh basically that if you are the one bringing upon the changes, it's much easier to not fear them. My life can/should/will change more drastically than many people I know... but I'll retain my sanity throughout the process because I'll 'know' (to a level of my choosing) what the fuck is going on (a hard requirement of this is that I do not use proprietary software). People usually fear change because it comes out of nowhere and hits them upside the head. My change is coming mostly from within (THOUGH THERE WILL BE PLENTY FROM THE OUTSIDE (AND OH BOY I AM EXCITED BECAUSE MY IMAGINATION CAN'T, BY DEFINITION, GUESS WHAT IT IS/WILL-BE :-D :-D :-D)).
