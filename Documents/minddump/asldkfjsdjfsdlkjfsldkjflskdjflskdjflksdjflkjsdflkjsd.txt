What I am doing when I say "them" both times to refer to both the scientists thawing me out and the software crackers both is analyzing a specific instance of chaos. There exists nothing else but my perspective of this instance of chaos. This is true but only to the one person experiencing it. That is to say, it's only true for me for me whereas someone else [...] it would only be true for them.

The point is, I don't have to do shit and the above is still true. I have the window lowered in front of the previous document ("them", thawing, decrypting)
for the lulz:
s/thaw/decrypt
applyTo(afk/irl);

I am born and now is now. It doesn't matter even if I don't write code, I will still most likely be indefinite. Still, I would like to re-assure that by paying for it up front and in advance.

Infinity is so vast that it is remarkable that I was born during the internet explosion. Shit is so cash.

There I am, in my shopping cart in the galaxy and I am looking up and to the left at two other currently existing entities and they are doctors and software reverse engineers.

Because reverse engineers can do what they can do, I think that there is a chance that once we can expose the proper medium for decryption of whatever genome bullshit...
...wait what am I on about?

(idk tbh)

(but I'll leave it anyways)

the proper medium to analyze and modify the human body. the proper level. the proper precision. nanomachines or smaller. once the reverse engineers are presented a proper problem/question (only askable once we have the editability to make answering it worthwhile (or something)) then it's just a matter of time. when the engineers/scientists/bleh can thaw a human out is just a matter of time, especially given moore's law of whatever doubling or something.
