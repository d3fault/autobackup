It can only ever be something relative that [re-]teaches you logic. For me it was Portishead - Dummy && 5meo-DMT. Logic is absolute.


I covered my mouth during the first trip. It was the best and I know it will never be as good. Depressing but whatever. I looked at my brother, saw myself, and resisted saying hi. Just lack of context I suppose. It was the first time of many, and I've still yet to "go public". To "launch". To "live" (ih (or even: to say hi)).


Re (knowing I am repeating a bit): Relatively, I am insane. Absolutely, I am sane. (New:) Relatively, I am a genius. Absolutely, I am stupid.

Funny as fuck how those two are opposite :)
