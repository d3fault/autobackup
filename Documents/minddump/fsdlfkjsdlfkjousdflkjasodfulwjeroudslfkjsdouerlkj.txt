this is working
blocking /b/ and facebook, that is


sure i watch a FUCK TON more movies etc
but i turn on my online machine far less often
when i do, i run out of things to do within MINUTES

then i am forced into booting my offline machine



i am definitely writing more
writing more is worth it.

it is organizing my brain.



code is... eh.

code is code is A PRODUCT OF AN ORGANIZED BRAIN

so that i don't write much code doesn't bother me. these documents are just as valuable. and they do make me feel less confused (lol,... for the MOST PART.... yesterday i went hysterical after being flooded with thoughts.... but now i am feeling OK. nothing like the bliss i was feeling when i wrote 'my brain is exploding. feels good man'. i was in the middle of coding/tweaking-from-coffee/daft-punk-alive-2007 when i wrote that.






tl;dr: i am more productive a week or two now that my /b/ + facebook withdrawls are almost complete. i still want to go look at pictures of my pretty friends (*COUGH* and family (kaylee/heidi)) and perhaps fap to them, but that's besides the point.
