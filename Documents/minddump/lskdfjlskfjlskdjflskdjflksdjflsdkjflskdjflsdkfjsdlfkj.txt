Coding is the art of using existing code (unless you code your own shit (but even then, you have to use it at some point in order for it to have any utility to you)). So if there was no free code, nobody would be able to code [efficiently (which is the point of programming)].


Intelligence is the art of using existing intelligence.
We bootstrap a consciousness off of the ~7 billion (est max on earth atm) other humans around us. Experiencing something is much different than reading about it (or seeing an existence from the 3rd person), so each of our perspectives in life is true random (unlikely, but guaranteed to be repeated exactly AT SOME POINT (i am experiencing all of those points simultaneously right now) given infinite time). At the VERY least, it is APPARENTLY random to the perspective of a human (any/all/most (probably every)). It is also APPARENTLY the most random thing we know of. It is so random that we have ourselves convinced that it is the most random thing possible (but there is no such thing. everything (every scenario) is equally likely to occur given infinite time. since we ourselves experience only a finite period of infinite time (this is not mandatory, just the way it is atm sadly), we are delusioned into thinking there isn't infinite time. But there is. And since there is, every reality that IS possible (does not break the laws of physics) is happening infinite times (since all of them 'equal' infinity, they are 'equal' to each other in number of occurances (originally didn't have "in number of occurances", but in re-reading I felt it could be misleading/wrong))) during every single vector frame.
