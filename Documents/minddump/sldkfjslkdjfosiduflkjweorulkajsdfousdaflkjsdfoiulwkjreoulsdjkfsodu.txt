My body/mind is rewarding me. After a bunch of hours of coding (and even being frustrated because of confusion at times), I feel great both physically and mentally (difference?)... and want to dive back in and code some more. I am not afraid of my launch anymore, I only anticipate it. I have never anticipated anything more in my life. "in my life" is already relative btw :).


Body/Mind are the same thing except that your brain is the most important and your body is essentially the vehicle. However, they are interdependent [for now].




Mind = CPU
Body = Mobo/Peripherals


Forelobe = L0 Cache
Subconscious / long term memory = L1,L2,L3,Memory,HDD,etc


And perhaps everything not in L0 has spotty recall functionality (or perhaps we just aren't tapping into it right!)...
