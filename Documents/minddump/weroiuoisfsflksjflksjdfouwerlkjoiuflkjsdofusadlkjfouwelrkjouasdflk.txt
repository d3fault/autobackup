"Suggestions" are the key to collaboration (good), and the root underlying cause of all/most (almost all ;-P?) humans being stuck in a state where they are merely reacting to their chaotic environment (bad).

The neutral suggestion is the hidden evil (but not always. It can be hidden good too). Good suggestions (as in, a bug report for a piece of software... or some FRIENDLY and well thought out advice intended to improve a peer)... are obviously good. Bad suggestions (poorly formed advice ("you need a haircut")) are also bad, but are easy to identify/ignore/correct/whatever (which to do is also difficult to determine). The neutral suggestion can be interpretted either way, depending solely on the receiver's state of (being? mind?). Our chaotic environment means neutral suggestions can be taken in a variety of different ways.

Music suggestions are a tricky subject. If someone suggests some new music to me... GREAT! I can try them out and see if I like them. If someone suggests that my music sucks.... what purpose does that serve? If, more neutrally, a girl I like writes about how she doesn't like a particular band (she posts it on a public forum), I in reading that am likely to get swayed toward also not liking the band. Her post was neutral (perhaps a list of music she likes + didn't like), but had a negative effect.
