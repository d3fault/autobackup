Pleasure and pain both break my concentration (as my kitty is rubbing my feet/legs while I'm trying to code (grr (even though feels soft n all))). The only way for me to concentrate is in an isolation chamber. Sensory deprivation.

Semi-related, but mental instead of physical: compliments inflate my ego and reinforce him as the driver of my will. Obviously insults modify me too. Fuck off with both.

Fuck off with physical pleasure/pain. Fuck off with mental compliments/insults. I mean unless I'm just chillen and not trying to think about something, in which case alternate sporatically back and forth for both categories (variety). Suck my dick and then punch me in the face as I'm cumming in your mouth.
