paranoia's taking over and i have broken my no input/output rule numerous times


i saw an image on /b/:


"blah blah blah infinite multiverse means somewhere you love me back"

and the image was a kid with slightly long hair (about my length) sitting/laying in a grassy field under a tree staring into a vibrant outer space


OH FUCKING REALLY

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?


GG ILLUMINATI?



i mean i said it over mobile text so it certainly is plausible

but jesus fucking christ


is this my 'signal' that i've been waiting for?


or are the bastards just ripping me off as usual?


or paranoia?


or collective conscience?


jesus fucking shit balls christ i need to fucking launch asap i am literally losing my mind and want to shoot myself in the head every time that shit happens
perhaps that's why they do it -- they don't want competition and want to pin me down
i will fight it
i hope
no


i know it.

i am willing it.
it will happen.
or i will die trying.
