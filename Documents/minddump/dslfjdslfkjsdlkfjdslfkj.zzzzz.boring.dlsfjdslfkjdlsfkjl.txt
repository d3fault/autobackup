It's said that "if you fail to plan, then you plan to fail". That is to say, failing to plan IS EQUAL TO planning to fail.

However, in the software world, we (our software) must plan to fail (so that it can recover/minimize-losses/etc). Tons of planning goes into failing. We do plan to fail, but that does not mean we fail to plan, so the two are not equal. I guess it's better written: "If you fail to plan, then you ALSO plan to fail".
