What do K-Holes and K-Maps have in common? d3fault loves them both dearly.


What does every female have in common? They all want my nuts in their mouf.


So let's say for the sake of argument that 100 represents 'straight' and 0 represents 'gay'. 50 would mean bi. I am 75% straight since I like trannies. Since both gay and bi are defined as "liking men", I am neither (had: not either). 25 would be "Like men and trannies" (or I suppose even "like men and girls dressed as men"?? (see!? there are too many permutations guh))
