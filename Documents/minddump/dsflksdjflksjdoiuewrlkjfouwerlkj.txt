If we are granted legality (by case law) in "thought-inducing-music-listening", how much talking do we have to do in order for it qualify as fair use? What if you're only speaking for 5 seconds out of the 3 minute song.. but those 5 seconds are GROUNDBREAKING and REVOLUTIONARY and... (as an example)... are the solution to nuclear fusion!!!??? Does the song writer now own that solution?

How does that even work?
A work can infringe on the copyright of another...
...but does that mean the new work does not longer exist (lol sorry reality says it does)? Isn't copyright-able?
Clearly there's an issue with DISTRIBUTING such a work... but what happens to it otherwise?
It is only allowed to sit on the author's machine / possession and is illegal to share?


CLEARLY a video of me dancing to music is a new work. If you remove the music, there's the work!
But up until the music is removed, what does it qualify as? Is there a special category of non-distributable "copyright infringing works"? Where is the index of them? Is the author forced to delete the infringing works? Meh I bet there's an answer to this somewhere... I just am a noob to all this legal shit. I feel a lot smarter than when I woke up this morning, however :-P...











I was genuinely not thinking about going public at the time. The music was just... playing.... and I was merely thinking/speaking. There might be a "one time" exception made for me... but it'd definitely set some sort of precedent...
