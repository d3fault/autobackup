so i need to go through my previous shit and shred anything that falls under the following two criteria:
a) cp ~ possession only, talking about it is fine
b) anything that i think will get me killed for sure

what to do in doubts?
what to do if 50/50 on the matter?

should i even allow the latter?
(a) is very obvious. fuck prison.
(b) seems like kneeling to one knee in a sense.. and bowing my head to some foreign entity (whoever they may be)

but i would justify it as me covering my ass
which is by definition: hiding something
so it's not 100% truth mode

but is it worth it?
to be 99.999998% truthful?
that .0000002% will be dug and sought and a heavy weight... disproportionately too
it will be the heaviest because it will be [one of] the only

bliss
ecstacy
mental orgasm 24/7 (like arnold's weight ones except bettar)
can only possibly come with 100% truth

i should not hide anything
but i should reword some things
shred the old versions
but get all the same shit out so i have nothing to hide

shred anything you KNOW will get you killed. simple as that.
hide nothing.

since you've really done nothing wrong at this point, you can be ok
but words and declared intentions (i don't recall any explicitly, but i wouldn't doubt there are some) could very well get me killed
