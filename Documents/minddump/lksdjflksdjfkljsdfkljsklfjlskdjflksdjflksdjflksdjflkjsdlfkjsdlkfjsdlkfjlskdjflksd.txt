Lobbying is legal. In conclusion, copyright infringement will always be taken more seriously than the threat of brainwashed citizens. In conclusion to that conclusion, DMCA-compliance for works whose deletion would facilitate brainwashing tactics, is optional. I'm not saying "that's how it should be". I'm saying "that's how it HAS to be. that's the only sane way. it's the only logical way".

I acknowledge that it opens a vulnerability going in the OTHER direction now: copyright infringement can be disguised as works-whose-deletion-would-facilitate-brainwashing-tactics. Those cases should be handled specially, but a bit of copyright infringement is not nearly as bad as brainwashed citizens. If that simple claim is decided/ruled against, I think it's my right to go absolutely apeshit and start killing EVERYONE (starting, of course, with the CEOs of corporations lobbying for stronger copyright enforcement) -- but I won't since that won't solve anything damnit (resillient system is resillient).

Bleh.
I'm not breaking the law, I can't be. I'm not doing anything evil. Brainwash is evil! The law must be on my side (even if it requires changing). It must. There is no "otherwise". It simply must. --- Appeals to the Supreme Court do sometimes work.
