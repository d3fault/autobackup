I'm fucking ziplining now, in this middle ground. Dropping sounds fun, but eh, might as well hang on and hope the building I'm headed straight for is made out of cardboard.

It was supposed to be an instantaneous hop through a vector window. Not launched -> launched. I created a middle ground that is guh. Losing confidence and just holding my grip. Death (drop) or death (hard wall) or success (cardboard wall). Death via drop is honestly the easiest :-P...
