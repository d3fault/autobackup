The bible is not accepted as scientific evidence because it points to itself as evidence of it's evidence-worthiness.

Existence itself can only ever point to itself as evidence of it's evidence-worthieness... so wtf?


I thought later on this more and concluded that although all our tests of existence are WITHIN existence, they are "logical" tests reproduceable by any human.
