Food and water and oxygen all taste better when you're passionate about [something]. I've been coding for almost 10 years and it wasn't until roughly a week ago that I became truly passionate. I used to say "all I do is code" but what I really meant was that all I ever thought about was coding and I'd try and try to get into code mode... but it would general fail and I'd code AT MOST a few hours a week. Now I am living and breathing code. I am cranking out thousands of lines a day and it feels amazing.

A switch flipped in my mind. Idk if it was the lock on the door or just the week of no computers when my parents were gone and it was just me and my bro and weed and ecstacy and that notebook........ and me feeling disgusted with myself for STILL not having anything accomplished........ but man I have such... drive.... and I don't see it ever going away. Nor do I want it to.
