"think while doing"
I was playing hedgewars and I was auto-pilot walking towards an enemy hog. I turned around after a few steps as I realized I didn't have enough time to actually attack him, and where I just came from provided better cover.

The "auto-pilot" until "other plan devised" was notable to me, and the purpose of this document.

We are on auto-pilot as pure reactions to our environment [most of the time (only through consciousness/will can we be otherwise)]. We go about our existence, surviving, reacting, thinking ALONG THE WAY, but [almost always] never actually concluding/deciding anything at all.

Yes, the auto-pilot is good instinctive behavior (I save time by "walking towards the nearest enemy" (and it is especially true when I'm waiting for recent kills to hand over weapons to my own hog (highlander mode))), but our entire life's focus becomes consumed by it, and that is bad.
