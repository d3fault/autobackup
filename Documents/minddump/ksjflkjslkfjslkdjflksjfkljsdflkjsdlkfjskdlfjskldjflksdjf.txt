My most reliable ad blocker is my hand in between my eyes and the monitor. When I pirate movies I don't want to even read about the new releases (seems like movies are getting worse and worse (you'll never enjoy film as much as you did in your teenage/early-20s years, because it's when you got to experience about a centuriy's worth of 'the best of the best' movies in a relatively short period of time (no waiting in between etc))). When I look for music to play on that popular video site (gg 2014), I block out the suggested bullshit and front page bullshit too.
