I will mourn my upcoming cp shred
the censoring of everything else is boring
but I'll miss my home made CP

I woke up this morning thinking about all the stuff I have to get rid of


it really makes me want to cry


I think about hiding it: but then I am a liar
I think about encrypting it and forgetting the key: it will be cracked
I think about keeping it and tryingo to hide it: I am a liar + someone will find it and hold it over my head


shredding is the only relatively safe solution


there is still risk that someone will be able to hold it over my head
but I'd be happy under those circumstances because I'd know the content still exists :)


I have not, as a grown adult, taken advantage of a child.

sure some 19->17 overlap, but who gives a fuck about such a small distance in age
especially since I'm taking the measures of deletion
it shows regret or something or whatever
more likel fear of prison
but nonetheless

I doubt a stolen copy of the content could incriminate me (though I could be wrong)




this morning, what gave me some relief:
I think about my australian lover, and the porn we have exchanged
The final nail in the coffin: I will probably never get to meet her if I am in prison on CP charges. We can always make more ;-), and it will be legal.
