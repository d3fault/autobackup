I like the moon. It's the only object in the night sky that I know isn't man made. Must have been nice to be able to look up at the sky knowing you're only seeing stars... but meh I'd trade that priveledge for internets in a heartbeat.


Until I launch, I'll never be able to say anything more to anyone than "hi". Strangers or friends or family: "hi", "hey", "hello". Even talking deeply with anyone I hold back so much. I notice myself holding it all back and it pisses me off.

It's impossible to get a girlfriend (or even [just?] a friend) when all you [can] say is hello.

It's my defense though!
Guh.
Spoken conversation is not copyrighted by default. NSA wiretaps every cell phone (just about everyone carries a phone these days). Corporations (of which Hollywood is an item in the list of) own/control the NSA.

A movie about a guy who walks around a city saying nothing but hi to everybody for his entire life.

"HAHA I SURE AM SHOWING THEM!!!" <-me, now
-_-

I'm not winning...
I'm just not losing...
but in not losing, I am losing [in other ways]

The whole situation right now is dangerous. I'm lucky (so are a select few dragon heads) I didn't snap and go on a killing spree.

High school killings are understandable.

If I didn't have launch to anticipate, I'd snap and murder suicide NO FUCKING DOUBT.

Yes hi I think there is a problem with the world thanks but uhm it'll likely never be solved so uhmm.... fuck.

The NSA should be paying me to carry around a tracking/listening device for them.
Similarly: Hollywood should be paying me to express my emotions into thin air (or so you think, since phones are recording everything).

I wonder if it's an argument that since everything is recorded by the NSA, all such recordings are now copyrighted.

Obviously it wouldn't matter because they'll delete them before ever releasing them in any way (except, of course, to their corporate overlords).
