I love exponentials just as much as my grandfather. Starting with a single satoshi (.00000001 bitcoins), after 20 days of ad slots being sold it's only up to $10 USD/day :-/. After 30 days, it's at $10,000 USD/day xD.

...I was worried it wouldn't work if I started so low and that I wouldn't make 1st/2nd months rent (renting to start, buying as soon as I can (still unsure about the housing issue, don't want apartment because shared walls = can't be loud (pretty much boils down to "a house in any location with decent internet is out of my budget" (but I'll cross this bridget when I get to it, and I'll fucking settle with an apartment if I must)))).
