My project is me. Rpc Generator -> Abc is not my project. It is the foundation and monetary bootstrap. Funnily, everybody sees my code as my project. They can't see passed it (because I am silent). They are ignorant so have attached/fixated themselves on (had:to (by itself TODOreq solve that ambiguity problem in code)) the only "project" whose existence they know of.
