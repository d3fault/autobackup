Both unfortunately and beneficially, we get what we put out. That's in terms of love and hate. I thought of this while imagining myself saying it to my father. I think it is maybe rare how it straddles neutral. That is to say, neutral is [probably] not-
Actually now that I REALLY think about it, if you are neutral (motionless, alone), you do get neutral back (from nobody (so therefore everyone)).
I am accidentally neutral. Wait no that's a backwards association.
But it is true that I am motionless and alone.
Relatively motionless. Keyboard strokes are definitely moving but there's so much more to be done with your body and you are fucking chained to this monitor. Devbox.

I think I _NEED_ to get Osios tri-screen working and I need to become an mobile motherfucker. I could just wander a jungle forever. Jungles always change and are a great source of random numbers (chaos). That they are inhabitated by such a wide variety of creatures, all trampling on the atoms on the jungle floor (had:thereof) (and eating etc), shuffling the atoms in a chaos ring of dust kicked up off the floor.


You start off as a rock, ..., you end up as a rock.

Or:
Q_FOREVER(You start off as a rock, ..., you end up as a rock) { }
oop
Q_FOREVER { You start off as a rock, ..., you end up as a rock }

We are usually rocks, but we are unable to realize it.
That is the definition of being human. Human is rock that realizes it's not a rock.
Wait what.
Ok I mean not JUST a rock. Just is the most important word. The definition hinges on the word just.
Human is rock that realizes it's not _JUST_ a rock.

You can kill me but I will always exist.
Tempted to add "again", but idk kinda cheesy and unnecessary. You can't differentiate the agains from the nows anyways.
It is always now and here and you are always alive.
