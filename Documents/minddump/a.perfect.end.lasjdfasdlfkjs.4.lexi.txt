i keep thinking about lexi, how we might have to put her down soon
and i'm wanting to do it myself
instead of her being in a room filled with strangers and having to feel a needle poke, i want to make for her a beautiful ending

i want to take her out to the desert, let her wander around while i dig her grave. who cares if she gets hurt/eaten/lost (doubtful anyways)
after i dig the hole, i pick her up and hold her like my baby and tell her i love her. eye contact and hugs, final goodbye
i set her down and get a bag of bacon out of my car, as well as my shotgun
i feed her the bacon near the hole, and right as she's finishing it, black screen. for her that is (but see below)
i also want to videotape the entire thing

reference 1: i could publish the video to youtube and blackscreen mere milliseconds before pulling the trigger. i don't think youtube would allow the showing of it. sort of like a sopranos reference. the viewer knows exactly what i'm going to do... the shotgun is already aimed/in place (at the back of her head)

i love lexi and i wish she could live infinitely... but i see her time coming up
