I wonder if I am predicted. I wonder if my prediction that I am predicted is predicted. I wonder if my predic[so on and so forth infinitely]. I wonder if the infinite recursion is predicted. I wonder if the prediction of infinite recursion is predicted [ditto infinitely].

I think I'm missing some words "prediction" in these sentences (since the predicter goes back and forth), but I am too lazy to re-think it.
