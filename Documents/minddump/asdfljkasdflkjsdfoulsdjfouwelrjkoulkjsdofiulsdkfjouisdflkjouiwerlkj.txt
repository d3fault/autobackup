Infinite time means there was no beginning so the question of "where did matter come from" doesn't make sense. It's just infinitely bouncing around the universe forever and always. It hurts my brain to think about but honestly I can't think of any way it came into existence. It doesn't make sense if you don't start with 1.

"Where does the sunlight come from?" -- "The sun"


but really it comes from nowhere, it just bounces around and singularities and then explodes over and over and over infinitely...

I wish there was (or will be?) an answer to this... but I'm not going to hold my breath...


"Where did it all come from? Where did the '1' come from?"
