I don't believe suicide exists. I do believe I have free will, but I'm _CERTAIN_ that I cannot exist in a universe where I'm dead. I am not afraid of death, because there's always a branch where I am not dead. Emotionally/instinctively/'MICRO'ally, I fear death... but I needn't once I understand what I am (a result (had:product) of infinite time (had:infinity)). I ain't no multiplication thang you can't multiply by infinity yo.
