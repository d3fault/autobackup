The reason I am not doing an LGPL/BY-SA or DPL/BY-SA split (code/content, respectively) is because of the following: suppose I'm fucking a tranny and I pull out and shoot my wad all over her(?) back, and suppose the pattern formed in spots of cum, when interpretted as binary/ascii/whatever, form some valuable piece of code that I end up wanting to use. By releasing content under a software license, I ensure that I (because others might make be making the hypothetical video so 'relicensing' might not be an option) and downstream recipients retain the ability to "link to" (software term) the code/cum. We live in a world of chaos after all. If you don't think "code" can randomly emerge like that, look in the mirror and describe yourself without contradicting what you just claimed (good luck).
