Everyone appreciates life, they only differ in HOW they appreciate it.
a) You can appreciate life so much that you're not going to waste it [being afraid]!
b) You can appreciate life so much that you're going to protect it at all costs.
c) Probably tons of other ways I don't care to mention/think-about...

Is any ("either", focusing just on (a) and (b)) way "wrong"? No.

"Protect it at all costs": the cost is happiness. But yes of course ack the counter-argument: gotta be alive to feel anything at all.
Live in fear with the hope that you'll occassionally be happy?

I'm fucking miserable. Living in fear/private/encrypted depresses the fuck out of me, to the point of suicide. Sure maybe tiny itty bits of happiness here and there, but bleh nothing even remotely close to how happy i COULD be. The tiny itty bits of happiness I do feel do not justify the private/encrytpted life I live (typo:love) -- I'd rather be dead. Private/Encrypted < Dead < Public/Launched

I mention fear like it's boolean. It isn't. I'm not going to be fearLESS (as in, without fear altogether), that's impossibru. I'll just be significantly less afraid (OTOH, maybe the fear will be amplified by orders of magnitude once I'm public/launched. This is actually very likely and makes sense. I guess that I'll simply be "dealing with it", and trying to not let it affect me so much).
