i keep trying to throw myself into coding only mode
trying to stay there
but it's so fucking hard
i just get so... guh
so... worn out. just want to 'take a break' and do nothing
but then i do do nothing and i get insanely bored
and then i stare at the wall
or my desktop
and write these random ass notes
which pass the time
and relieve.... stress? pressure?

idfk. they also waste time.
i need to code more.
i need to find that field and start my log cabin
build a satellite dish and give kaylee my coordinates
then do whatever, code, fingers, music, dance, live (ih AND eye)
live live
livelive.com?
lihveleyeve.com?
rofl lame


she is a dream but she is also reality~
