because i don't think we're here for some divine reason, i think it is definitely possible for us to implant ourselves as relative-immortal beings (can still die by brain tissue destruction. gunshot etc). there is no logical reason why it isn't possible. it is simply a matter of mastering the required technology. the continuing trend (moore's law) in computing: computers get faster and faster. another observed law but i don't think it has a name: computers keep getting smaller and smaller.
