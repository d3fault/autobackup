Life exists in an "extremely" delicate balance, but within that delicate balance there exists an "extremely" large amount of wiggle room (for free will (but not just), etc). Math is fucking nuts and our brains can't comprehend infinity. Our extremely delicate balance of walking along a series of laws of physics (the ones required to produce life) is only "extreme"-ly difficult to put into our brains. Similarly (yet, the two ranges of numbers are also "extremely" (;-P) far apart), the wiggle room afforded to us is ALSO more than we can comprehend. An example of how the wiggle room buys us more than just free will: jumping up into the air offsets the earth's path around the sun, but not enough to make a "noticeable" difference (this example might be false because I am dumb, but others like it are true).
