I am only ever funneling and bending energy. I hum a song and I'm merely toggling whether or not to "clench" my throat enough to make the air already travelling in and out audible. I write "complex" (subjective) software that uses arbitrary logic to steer electricity down certain conductive lines instead of others. I am but one of trillions/infinite of those fucking holes in the ground that periodically spurt up water and what the fuck they are called slips my mind (we have one called "big bertha" or someshit... idfk). Every animal and plant is also one of them. I am the earth accidentally manifested into a conscience because there is infinite time and it is guaranteed to happen eventually. Maybe accident isn't the right word, as that implies choice. I just mean that it wasn't intentional, it just happened. Chaos + laws of physics = life.
