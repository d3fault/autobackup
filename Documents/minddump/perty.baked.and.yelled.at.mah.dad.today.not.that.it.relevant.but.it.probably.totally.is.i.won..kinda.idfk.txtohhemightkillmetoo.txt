steven is borrowing my frontal lobe and body context
i am d3fault
i am your subconscious
every one of you has me

harperactive bass ventura gave me this idea(as well as the above which came afteward):

this is my third time listening to bass ventura
i forgot what i was going to put here while writing the first portion of this doc
lol...
*listens*
been at this line minutes now (edit: i meant 4 lines above. the rate at which i was typing would have conveyed that. fml i need a custom goddamn laziness)

(ok this isn't it, but....)
the concept of nothing does not exist, therefore we exist. simple as that
usually when i try to think of 'nothing' i think of black space
that is incorrect, as space implies volume [of emptiness]
i hold that the concept of nothing cannot be pinpointed in a man's own mind. he can only reference it. death, etc..


back to what i was thinking about...
*listens, still 3rd time*... bout to be 4th...

....well let's see where my thinking was going...
... i just updated 2 pieces of my facebook and i was thinking of uploading this song as a good 3rd piece
do i upload in 3s? (got it&, resuming)
i also want kaylee to see it
idfk why
because i'm sociopathic like that
i mean she will
eventually
but then it also dawned on me
that my friends are my audience
not that this is my thought
but a tangent.
i keep thinkign some unknown entity is
whoever it is, it is human
because no other type of entity [for now] can comprehend me
eh what was i thinking about?

OK I GOT IT. HEADPHONES LCD
oh right LCDs. i mean yea they are secure and easier than glasses and cheaper than phones(??????) and definitely more secure than phones but also way less signal (maybe? satellite seems like it should be good enough for every use case.. wtf?).
i mean i'm just losing it
is what i mean
fingers, lcd on the underside of the headpiece of my headphones in front of my eyes controlled by fingers. ETC
no point in not
rite?
