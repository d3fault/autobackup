i can't get kaylee out of my head
i want to write her a large letter
explaining my feelings for her

that phone call was too short and too out of nowhere
and it's a bit depressing that she won't respond to the texts

but i wasn't in persuasion mode at that point, mostly just rant mode. i typed
rand instead of rant at first. rofl

but anyways, back to kaylee
blah.
there, enough said
i don't want to write it here because then i will lose the will to write a
letter
