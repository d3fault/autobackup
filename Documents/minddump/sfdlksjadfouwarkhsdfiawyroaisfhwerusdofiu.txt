i just re-watched the entire house series
pretty much back to back
multiple episodes per day etc

but anyways

i've realized i'm a coward too
all this typing about trying to decide
is me trying to logic my way through it

i think, especially in my situation, that finding a logical answer is impossible

FORGE ahead

forge does not mean clean

logic is clean

forge is dirty

you will never have a guarantee of safety
you will die.
