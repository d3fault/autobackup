Marijuana and Mushrooms aren't illegal because there's a genuine health concern; Marijuana and Mushrooms are illegal because they expand the mind, which might lead the masses to understanding they're being used like oxen, which might lead to dramatic change in government, which would cause those in power to lose their power.

I don't give two shits that I'm breaking the law when it comes to Marijuana and Mushrooms. I know I'm not doing anything evil and I know that the people who keep such laws in effect are themselves evil. Keeping a human from knowledge is evil. Just because evil owns the government and makes evil laws, doesn't make me feel the slightest bit evil when I disobey.
