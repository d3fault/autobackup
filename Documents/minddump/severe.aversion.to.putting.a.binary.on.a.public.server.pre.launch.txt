I have a severe aversion to putting the Abc2 binary(ies) on a public server.. just feels like data compromise etc. And yet that's supposed to be the order of activation: Abc2 before Hvbs. But just last night I came up with a solution: Hvbs first and for content I cam the compiling/installing/turning on of Abc2. It might affect my "wearable music computer in first 24 hours" thing (probably only if something goes wrong), but fuck it.
