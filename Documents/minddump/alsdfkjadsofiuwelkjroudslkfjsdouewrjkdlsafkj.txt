this last thanksgiving was my favorite one so far, idk why
perhaps it was the pig that gave us all something to... focus on
we like formed a circle outside around the pig
just... well formed... family event, idfk
we need a pig every time.


i was just myself
i didn't plan any words for kaylee
it just went randomly
and it was good.


i felt even more attracted to her
and i even felt like i malipulated her into... liking me.. by simply playing with her daughter
it was fun regardless, making her daughter do flips etc on the bed
but just WATCHING HER WATCH US play (she probably didn't trust me lol) made me think her seeing her daughter having so much fun (and of course, i wonder if Eddie (current bf, also there) can make madison smile, laugh, and squeal as loudly) would get into her subconscious. i definitely overthought it (while playing with daughter), but it wasn't pre-planned!! (sociopathic)


guh idfk, my feelings toward kaylee get stronger and stronger and i do feel like i do have a chance
i also wonder if i should censor/shape myself around trying to win her
my entire life
minddump
etc

NO
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
be yourself.
she is not worth censoring, sorry kaylee
love you, but you're going to have to deal with my gross



but i do wonder if i could
i think i could
i am a manipulative son of a bitch
