Forgot to elaborate on the "programming is planning" thing. In fact I forgot what I even wrote after it. But I'm pretty sure I forgot to say: "for the computer". I, a human being, program (plan), the machine's exececution (action). The end and that is all. My actions are planning actions for a machine. Such a boring life. I want to go outside. FINGERS!!!!! I have a plan, the plan will work. There is work to be done before the plan can go into effect, but there isn't any reason I can see for why it won't work (aside from jacked (but I can try again by starting from scratch)). I am planning the routes that the electricity will take, which are incidentally switched (think like a railroad switch) by electricity (that was one of the first bootstraps in the computer world -- the plans are now soft, not hard).
