I find that 80% of the effort gets you there at 99% of the speed of 100% effort... but without all the additional stress and gray hairs. Relax, you're going to die anyways. That being said I am operating at nowhere near 80%. Living at home I cannot be "in the zone" (which is actually 100% imo -- because I LOVE/am-passionate about it) 24/7 because I am too frequently interrupted... or am at least expecting interruptions.

Employers would consider this document to be the work of the devil (lul)! They are constantly asking for "110%" because they want to squeeze the most profit out of you and they don't give a shit about your state of mind and/or well-being (what's the difference? physical/mental? stress affects both).

If you are passionate about the work being done, operating at 100% (especially 24/7/365) becomes blissful, not stressful.



THAT IS THE UTOPIA OF MY DREAM: THAT EVERY [WO]MAN WORKS 100% 24/7/365 AT THEIR PASSION AND IS IN A BLISSFUL STATE. THAT THEIR WORK (ART, WHATEVER (PROGRAMMING IS ART AND ENGINEERING WOOT)) DOES NOT "MAKE MONEY" SHOULD NOT BE RELEVANT. I BELIEVE THAT SUCH A WORLD WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PRODUCTIVE AND INNOVATIVE (ESPECIALLY NOT HAVING "AREAS OF OUR BRAIN THAT NEED TO BE AVOIDED FOR LEGAL REASONS") THAN OUR CURRENT FREE MARKET, WHICH JUST SQUEEZES THE LIFE OUT OF PEONS PRETTY MUCH. SURE THERE IS SOME INCITING OF INNOVATION BUT ONCE A SINGLE SUCCESSFUL INNOVATION IS DONE, THE REST IS USUALLY FOR THE INNOVATOR TO SIT BACK AND SQUEEEEEEZE IT FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.



Lastly (and completely irrelevant), I think adderall is the only thing that can make you work (even though this makes no mathematical sense) "above" 100%. 110%, whatever.
