"I think, therefore I am" is true but vague. Growing up I always interpretted it as: "I think I am, therfore I am" -- which isn't TOO FAR OFF (or is actually true, take your pick (idfk fuck it kinda drunk so yea (drunk philosophizing = bad idea)))... but I think it's better to be overly verbose than not verbose enough (...and he wasted the rest of his life explaining every teeny tiny bit (but he enjoyed it so it wasn't a waste (but he got nothing accomplished so it was (but there's nothing to accomplish so it wasn't (oh shit I am getting verbose in my contradictions too!)))...). I think it's better as "I have the ability to think; I have the ability to analyze whether "a thing is true" is true or false and to see that in my mere analysis of it, logically the answer must be either true or false, therefore SOMETHING is known (whether or not "a thing" is known doesn't have to be [known?]).... blah blah yea there is a knower I am the knower, a knower has to exist and be alive, therefore I exist and am alive.


Ok that explanation got out of hand: I have the ability to think, therefore I exist. Yes it says the same thing, just with more precision. I hate metaphors/analogies/subtleties/ambiguities. Actually I quite like analogies/metaphors for describing reality ("I don't write fiction, I describe reality as verbosely as possible using visual metaphors/analogies" -me), but I don't like them when they require a high IQ to 'detect'/interpret (hence 3xplain.it).
