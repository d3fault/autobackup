i am a whatcha-ma-call-it (smothered? suffocating? etc i forget) artist
my computer is my canvas, my persons is the paintbrush


smothered suffocating squashed silent censored starving oppressed (suppressed? it is partially my fault after all) squeezed


damnit what was that word?
it's a cliche saying...
but now i definitely feel it fits: i need a libre environment to live in. i will make it and i will live there. it will all be legal within US law


the only real difference between "normal" society and "libre" society is that new works are libre-by-default. In USA, a new works is automatically copyrighted with ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. under a libre society, only works that are libre are welcome. fuck off and die.


as a formal politician, i would try to change USA so that "normal society" now defaults to libre content
i refute the idea of "illegal content"
fuck off and die
