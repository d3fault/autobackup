Politicians have an incentive to create friction/obstacles for businesses. Friction creates jobs, which creates taxes. There are more immediate benefits to creating friction, and an immediacy is needed in order for them to benefit (since they have relatively short terms in office). Maybe they can/do see the longer term benefits of there being less friction, but those aren't THEIR benefits, they're the benefits of the businesses and society as a whole.
