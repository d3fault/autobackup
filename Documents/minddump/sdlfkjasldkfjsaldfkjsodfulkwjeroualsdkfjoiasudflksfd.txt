Epicurus said it first, and I've said it tons of times in tons of different ways... but it's pretty much this: you can never not be alive. It is only true for the first person (those around you can die, and you can die relative to them), but you can only ever be in the first person to begin with.

I am glad that "fun" exists. Since life _IS_ an inescapable jail, I'm glad this particular emergence of it has pleasure.

Although perhaps pleasure/pain is necessary for self awareness (those universes without it don't make much [mental] progress)... which would mean it "always is" (relatively speaking) as well.
