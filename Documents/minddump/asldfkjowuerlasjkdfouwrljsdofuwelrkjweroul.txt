in retrospect, the story of my life will be the saddest story ever told (to date)
because, unlike movies and books, it will be entirely real

i'll document my successes
as well as my depression
and eventual death


you cannot rid yourself of depression entirely
you can only fight it off to the best of your ability

everbody dies, therefore depression is inevitable
