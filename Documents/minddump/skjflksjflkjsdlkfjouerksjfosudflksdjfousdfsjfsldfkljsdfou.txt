I can't serialize, compress, and encrypt my lust for life (that was the original thought, but a derivative had later added on the words "any longer"). I can't sit in silence until the world becomes a safe place in some... say... 100-1000 years. It's now or never. I mean, sure, I _could_ serialize/etc, but when the time came to decrypt/decompress/deserialize... I wouldn't know how to utilize that which I've stown away. It's now or never: I wear this hat or my head changes shape. I fully acknowledge that my decision could cost me a shorter life, but I'd rather live 5 good years than OVER 9000 dull ones. There is also no guarantee that the world will ever be a safe place (but hey, it's a [remote] possibility).

The sleeper must awaken ;-).
