It's fascinating that every other human brain can understand what I understand. Everyone else has the potential to get where I am now.

Hell, someone else might have already gotten here before... but I don't read books/etc so I have no idea.

However, it is an experience. Reading it wouldn't be the same (so sorry to inform you readers of that -- you reading this is not even remotely the same (or maybe it is if you're lucky/smart)).
