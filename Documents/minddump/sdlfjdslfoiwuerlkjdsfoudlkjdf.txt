In the southern hemisphere, the probability that a human will be left handed, is equal to the probability that a human will be right handed in the northern hemisphere. This is because the sperm (carrying the gene that governs X-handedness) is spiraling towards the center of the egg in a different direction (clockwise vs counter-clockwise) in each respective hemisphere.
