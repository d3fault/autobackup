this "merge fuck ton of changes" while "inverting server/client logic" and "removing obsolete code/design" and "finishing/creating client ack"... task... is the hardest one i've ever tackled. I'm inch-worming it. So fucking lost and yet I am not really doing... anything at all (until I get to the ack stuff at the end).
