It is not the goal of the free market to let everyone have/own/do-will-with their own time. In fact trying to accomplish such tasks using the free market is like trying to solve the perpetual machine problem (btw I found out my pulley perpetual machine sucks (and why: because you pull twice as much rope)). I thought of a counter-argument to this and thought I squashed it but then I thought of the counter-counter to it today. Been thinking about it for a few days. The counter argument to the free market being a perpetual machine is that money scales infinitely (a law of mathematics) and in both directions. The counter-counter which I've pretty much already mentioned is that "life" (time) does not scale. It is a static piece. The only thing the free market will ever do is get a lot of people to work together in a pyramid structure, giving the person at the top (or the person smart enough to MAKE a "top" (business)) the majority of the time (and the power to delegate it).

I think a person not owning their time alive is bullshit. Robotic communism (or some "vote anarchy" (true electronic democracy IS anarchy: majority rules) where robots are running the background tasks that we don't give a shit about (survival)) has a huge win right here.
