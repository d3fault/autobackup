"want" is emotion

"do what you want"

"decide what you want"


so... if i WANT to 'shape' myself, because i am emotionally compelled to do so, it isn't really shaping myself?
and similarly, if i WANT to rig myself to a 'random' idea feeder (previous ideas, fed in random order (which can be ignored at any time to do what i 'want' at any given time)), it is deciding/living still?


WANT isn't shaping THEREFORE courtship isn't manipulation?
some pretty deep thoughts (bro)



if i want to shape myself to 'earn' kaylee, it is a valid life?





i'm obsessed with planning
i know i've said this before, but just go with the flow bro



contradiction:
'stop planning' vs. 'code' (coding REQUIRES planning, gah)




another, which might contradict above: it is unfair to both kaylee and myself
it is unfair to both anygirl and myself
s/kaylee/anygirl
anygirl = 'beautiful brunnette with the GOOD look to her' (my `fetish`, though the hair color part isn't THAT important)
re: GOOD, i just watched oliver twist last night. the same 'meloncholy' that mr. brown or whatever detected in oliver twist. i DO think you can read people like that (i also think it's easy to fake: i can do it :-D)

it is unfair to anygirl and myself to SHAPE MYSELF (here's teh contradict) for her
she doesn't get to see the real me
what is the real me?

isn't, like i said earlier..
the 'real me' is what i feel EMOTIONALLY COMPELLED to do????

so if i am emotionally compelled to "shape myself"/"manipulate her"/courtship, then that is the real me????



fuck so confused but do think i'm making progress
human progress, not just myself


it's hard to discuss emotion without attempting to explain it
i can refer to the word only~
