Fuck code, tbh
I want to make music
That should be what I focus on
should be my goal

1% of 1% can appreciate my art this is code
(1% of population is coders, 1% of coders are smart enough to appreciate it)

99% of the world appreciates music

it's like living in the now
your art is instantly appreciated by practically everyone

yes, i want to do both
but sometimes I just want to step away from the keyboard and make a jam
I can't play an instrument
and taking the time to learn will divert me from course

I need to retire
then I can make music
and code with less stress (and on things that don't necessarily generate a profit)

Life is easy.
I'm currently going through the hardest portion of my life.
Some days it feels like it will never end
Others I swear I can see the light at the end of the tunnel

I see the light currently
but I know the path in between is rocky

treacherous, no
I won't die

I'm just going to have sore feet
