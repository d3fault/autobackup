Expression failure. As an intelligent person, I'm able to determine that declaring "I am intelligent" to my peers won't persuade most anyone. I'm holding a brown cardboard box of goods and I just want to do a [two-handed] shot put spin and throw it's contents all over the grassy field. For now I'm just a guy with a box. Lot's of people have boxes.
