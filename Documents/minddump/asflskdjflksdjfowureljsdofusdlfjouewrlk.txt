"freedom of speech" vs. "illegal content"


I refute the latter. It is a direct contradiction to the (much more important) prior. I will stand up for that right, though I will not civilly disobey it. It isn't worth the guaranteed raid. d3fault will tackle it. d3fault will express my true opinion. There will not exist such a concept as "illegal content" on d3fault. I've said this before: "child porn" or "freedom of speech", take your pick.
