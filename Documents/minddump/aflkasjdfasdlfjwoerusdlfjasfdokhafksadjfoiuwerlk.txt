i do worry that i won't make as much money because i'll release my ideas CC-BY-SA right away
but i also worry that they'll be stolen right out from under me

at least this way i get credit


and there will be contributors that do my work for me for free [and 'free' so i will accept them]
there will also be proprietary jackers
but at least they can't now patent + prevent it (PRIOR WORKS FUCK YEA)








a bigger fear though
is that i will be forced to interact with the community (how else will i get open contributions back to me?)
and that the community (or at least content within) will be brainwashed and lead me astray

with the entire community double checking my every move..
it's STILL possible for me to be led astray


cutting myself off from all human interaction is the only way to prevent that
but then i can't benefit from releasing all my works (the open contributions/implementations of my ideas)



there is no perfect solution
i'll have to trust/crowd'source my 'watch my back'ers
