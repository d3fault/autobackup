Kaylee has to see "the real me" and accept who I am



With relation to my launch, which I'm not like 99.999999999999999% is a full go and most likely uncensored (sans prison-inducing items), I cannot censor my vulgarity on her behalf. It is who I am. I am still a good person. All I can hope for is that she'll see through and not care about my vulgar behavior and will embrace and love me for who I truly am.


I interrupted myself when I had the thought at first (it was while standing in the bathroom, and before writing the previous 2 as well (but not before thinking of them)). "She has to see the real me" is what did it. To say anything else is to say that she would NOT see the real me, or that she would see the fake me.


OUT OF LOVE, IN THE NAME OF LOVE, ETC ETC ETC YADA YADA YADA CHEESY ASS BULLSHIT GOES HERE: I cannot lie to her in such a way. I cannot present a toned down version of myself in hopes of "hooking" her like a fish. I mean, I could. I have the ability to. But I will not. Love, and my limited understanding of it, dictates that I cannot do that to somebody I love. My _ONLY_ coherent/sane/remaining option is to be myself and cross my fingers and hope that infinite multiverse theory is real and that she loves the real me
