I laugh hysterically to myself. People think there's an inside joke. It is internal, but it isn't a joke: I'm ecstatic to be alive and to know what it means to be alive. Simple as that. Chemicals and chaos and pleasure and pain and DRUGS and music and love and art.


Yea, music is an art, but the sentence sounds better that way.
