physical + digital security parralols

Both physical and digital securities are impossible imo. I find loopholes in every scheme I devise. Still, I'm willing to overlook the contradictions for digital (bitcoin/money (EVERYTHING ELSE WILL BE PUBLIC FUCK YEA)) for one reason that makes me giggle: if my physical security is compromised, I'm dead [and yet alive in alternate universe]; if my digital security is compromised, my money is jacked, and I have to stay in that universe where my money has been jacked :-/. This sounded funnier when I thought it up: like both are either "extremely paranoid" mode vs. "nope". I'm going with "eh pretty damn paranoid but obviously hackable because everything is" mode for Bitcoin/digital.

I think I died yesterday. I remember dying. I died and then woke up. I mean, I died in an alternate universe and then my consciousness merged with this one while I was asleep/dreaming. It seemed so real. Drifting off into the void I was confident and aware of what was happening: I knew I'd be back (already am). You can't kill me, I am existence.

Existence has 100% efficiency, which is why it's impossible to kill. Big collapse, re-explode [infinite times], here I am again/still. It's a seemless transition because I am not conscious in between.


I am invincible and yet powerless. I either restrict myself from my goals/dreams/abititions/desires, or pursue them and watch my environment be destroyed. Life is shit.

Life is shit, but can be great. Earth 2013 sucks, STOP WHINING YOU CUNT AND CHANGE IT. "Launch" (stupid) already fucking stop blagging in this bullshit notepad app
