Kaylee
is torturing my mind
i don't even know if she knows it
i don't even know if i want her
i know i do
but i also don't

i thought of this
sending this:

"please reject me so i can get you out of my mind. -d3fault ... ps i love you and want to be with you. -steven"

i guess that really summarizes it
do i have split personalities?
idk
but that isn't relevant
what is is the conflicting priorities
conflicts of interest
what do i _WANT_
i want both
fo sho
can i have both?
can i be d3fault with kaylee?
eh... idfk
I JUST DON'T FUCKIGN KNOW
that's what's driving me insane

i want to know
and all this
will be wasted wonder
if she rejects me anyways~

but at least i could focus on being d3fault
who i want to be

i'd just be lonelier
die sad'er
live less
in a sense

i want to live my life to it's fullest
so i want to be d3fault
AND i want kaylee

that is maximum throughput
maximum efficiency
which may not even be attainable


would i give up d3fault for her?
would i give up drugs for her?
would i give up insanity for her?

yes

probably.

but i don't want to have to
especially the drugs part ;-)
you fucking junky
you like drugs more than d3fault

uhh, DUURRRR
drugs are so easy
you just take em and sit there
no effort involved
d3fault has a shit ton of objectives and work to be done
and meh, insanity
it's more like i would settle for insanity by being with her
because if i become d3fault + drugs then i will be the most sane human in existence.

this makes no sense.
i just know i love her
and want to hold her in my arms
it's really splitting me in two
this mozart motivations is hitting the spot
so relaxing
even when it's UPPITY
so calm and i can think better than with dubstep
rofl
comparing mozart to dubstep
the uppity parts are comparable imo
except the mozart half doesn't hurt my brain
(i kinda like the hurt ;-))

ok bayck to kaylee
lawl.
she's invading my brain
i need to just get it over with
but i 
i
i just don't know what to say
i've tried to 'hand oug' with her plenty of times
you know what fuck it spoonerisms are fun and not worth correcting.
i see 99% of them

once i have my app coded to detect the erasing of them, then i will correct
but for now, just leave them
that habit might (hap) stick
but who cares
all illrelevant
rofl
this is fun
ok
back to kaylee....




ggggggggggggggggggoooooooooooooooodddddddddddddddddddddddddd
i feel so alive with her
even just thinking about her
is an anti-depressant
like everything's going to be ok
i can handle my own death knowing i and her will be holding each other as we slip away into non-existence

WAT DO
text? call? show up? wait until next 'family event' ??
fml.

i can't even analyze it
i'm getting nowhere
this document is just me venting
i am not making progress
with software i make progress as i type
i barely even have to think i just pound the keyboard and logic comes out

but here... i just sit and wonder and repeat myself over and over and exclaim how much i love her and want to hold her and be with her and die with her
she will make me a better person
and [probably/hopefully] i her

i want to peak 5meo with her
see if i could get her to my page

lol, good luck
she is in her own world
remember that..

she is so beautiful
maybe i should just leave her be

like a flower that dies if you pluck it
but still, i could speak with this flower
i can ask it if it wants me to pick it up and plant it in my garden so i can see it daily

this analogy fails.

i want to keep writing
because i keep hoping a solution will come up
i mean i know a solution
FUCKING TALK TO HER
but she's just unapproachable
i've asked to hang out
and nothing.
be more persistent
gah
i'm not a beggar
it's an unattractive quality anyways

wat do
even our texting gets nowhere
usually i can keep a bitch texting for hours/days [until i randomly stop]
but with her i'm just dumbstruck instantly
i know in person i could talk to her
but with family or via text or even on the phone
i just couldn't

but i can't just give up
wow
remember that
fact
it is so true
i can't just forget and pursue d3fault
leave the flower unquestioned

i have to try
like
even if i deduce i shouldn't try
i still can't not
it's like i don't have control over that portion of my brain

and yet, i can easily silence it after rejection
because it will have an answer
"no"
and that will be that
and i can move on and become d3fault
a god amongst atoms

implying i can't become d3fault, a god amongst atoms, if she said yes??
see i'm just unsure
i don't know if she'd limit me
i SUPPOSE i should break up with her if she did...

but maybe i wouldn't be able to
maybe my imagination would be enough
knowing that she said NO in some other universe
and i went on to become d3fault
would be enough???

oh how i want her to say yes
i'd take the significantly less productivity, power, money, fame (eww)... all for her
no questions asked

but i still shouldn't
shouldn't give up on d3fault

chances are, if she DID tell me not to be d3fault... i would be turned off by that and WANT to break up with her
as unfathomable as that sounds right now... it's not like i will forget how2logic

i just don't know
she seems crazy enough to support it all
to even be a part of it
to help me with it
to make me better
[to make herself better?]

i just don't know
but i know this
i love her

there are few things i know
i exist... i don't even know that for sure
though... if i'm going to get all specific... i guess i don't KNOW i love her
it could be a script i am processing telling me i love her
but, assuming i have free will
assuming i exist
then i know this:
i love her



is this just an infatutation?
will it die off?
will i grow tired of her?
who knows
nobody can ever predict the future

but you can regret not seizing opportunity
your entire life
you can live with that weight
even if her answer is NO
the weight will still be there
if it is unknown to you
that is fucking terrifying

so ask
confront
embrace
embrace wherever reality takes you
pursue d3fault, maybe in a more family-friendly/kaylee-modified way
which might be better in the long run
even censoring past [stuff]
lol "stuff"
maybe
not that i like censorship
but SOMETIMES it's necessary?
and bam now i am evil.
because that is what evil says too
but NO
NNOOOOOO
i refuse
i will not censor
she has to live with me
she must know the real me

i want to be truthful
i only want it with her
i'd rather be alone than be truthful with anybody else
except... of course... the entire world simultaneously ;-)

bah.
what am i doing
venting
ranting
counseling myself
shit works.
talking's easier... but i still live with my parents
and i am not broadcasting (therefore content can and will be stolen. niggers.)

just talk to her dude
BUT HOW
what do i say?

how do i arrange a hangout if she won't hangout with me?
i know if i use the word 'please' she'd do it
if i begged she'd do it out of pity
but GAH
then i'd get skewed results (an instant 'no')

i cannot think of a solution to this problem
and it pains me to think about
one of the few things i am unsure about
another being how everything got here... but i have accepted and moved on from that one
i believe that in 2012 it is not currently feasible to discover that answer
we are a long ways away from that


GOD DAMNIT
my 'insofar as' shit on nobodyme is way to revealing
google glass could have been derived directly from that
fucking niggers
fucking idiot
you are.
meh this doesn't belong in this document...   i just thought of it though...

omfg the mouse hover text over the ???? is sooo revealing
gah you're an idiot d3fault
or steven
or nobodyme
whoever the fuck you are
stop leaking your own shit
and you claim you're being spied on -_-
idiot.

still, the claim/statement 'history will be written with near 100% accuracy' is yours forever now
i guess that's good
but meh
CODE
MAKE
DO
don't just 'talk about' -_-
