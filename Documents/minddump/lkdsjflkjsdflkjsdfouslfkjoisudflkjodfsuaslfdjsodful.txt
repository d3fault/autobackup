There exist exactly two genders because:
a) Sex is more fun than masturbatin (1->2)
b) The threesome (with the third member being a hypothetical third gender) is several orders of magnitude more rare than 1on1 (3->2)

The "3->2" means that even if a third gender emerged, it would die off instantly because it wouldn't be able to (or, it wouldn't be as easy for it to) reproduce. There would also need to be two penises, OR SOMETHING. Yet more "orders of magnitude" more rare'ness, hence we cap quickly at 2. Getting 2 together is more rare than 1, but not nearly as rare as 3 (or 4 or 5 etc). Gender exists because "eh, it doesn't really affect evolution that much" (cost-wise). That and of course as already mentioned, sex feelsgoodman.

There were likely for a long time beings that were still in "self-clone" mode that would hump, purely for pleasure, other clones of themself. I forget my reasoning for this but I had some before writing it xD.

Weird thought/question (that contradicts the above): did masturbation exist when the species was only in clone-mode?
