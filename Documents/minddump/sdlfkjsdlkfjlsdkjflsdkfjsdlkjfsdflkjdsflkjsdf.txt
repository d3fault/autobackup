"I think it would be cool if some day we invented a way to capture your thoughts" -gary becher
me: "yea that'd be cool might happen"
i think he was saying it sarcastically and mocking me because:
Mouths are devices on a human which allow us to capture our thoughts into digital form

i actually don't think he was saying it sarcastically and mocking me, but it helps with the remembering-of to say it in this order, i was thinking he meant it like [and then i forgot]

with current science = mouth.timeLeft = finite;
with future science = mouth.timeLeft = -1; //or whatever you want to use to represent infinity

so I mean it can be deduced that as long as I don't die, I am already near infinite.
I actually doubt my survival, but death (had: "it") has yet to greet me.
Infinity is too large of a number to be able to comphrehend what behind alive for infinity is like. Therefore, if there are QList<Gods> which may only contain 1 God, he is himself alive infinitely and may have in fact created us. The bible is bullshit but I think that the idea itself is plausible. In the end it's a fucking coin toss because we don't have the science to solve it but who gives a shit if we don't have a God. Cry more churchfags.
