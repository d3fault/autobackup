The only people that will be able to stay in the software-driven-society 24/7/365 will be people that have figured out how to simulate robotic communism for themselves: basically business owners and/or investors etc etc (maybe someone makes enough ad revenue while using it, but doing so would be difficult (which is why I'm relying on ABC as a _business_ (take 3% or something) and not just a way to get ad rev for myself only)). Anyone with enough passive income to survive.

I will not solve that problem. I don't know of a solution to it [aside from robotic communism, which would be hard as fuck to pass].

We will set the standard. We will demonstrate IN YOUR FACE a superior way of living. Hopefully the majority get uber jealous and since THEORETICALLY the government is "by the people for the people", it _COULD_ change to some "blissful living through robotic communism" form of government (or some variation thereof). It could also just be retarded and be like "FREE MONEY INVENTED LEFT AND RIGHT BY FEDERAL RESERVE IN ORDER TO PAY FOR YOUR EXISTENCE IN BLISSFUL LIVING". Who does the work in _THAT_ case? I haven't a clue (foriegn countries?). Still, I like to think our politicians are stupid enough to see that as a good idea. LoL.

I (we) don't have the time to wait for the government to change. In fact it is a weird form of a bootstrap because I think the only way the government WOULD change is if the majority saw it and got uber jealous of it: the making jealous of is the bootstrap. It would never pass if there was nothing to be jealous of (aside from theory and words -- practically worthless by comparison).
