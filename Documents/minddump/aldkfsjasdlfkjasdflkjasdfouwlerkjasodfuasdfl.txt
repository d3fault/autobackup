You know, I do feel that I, Steven Curtis Wieler II (actually going to call about getting a fee for a name changed waived on monday (today's saturday... WHOOPS sunday 12:03am lmfao)), am born into an amazing time of existence. Like, the amount of influence I can push out... is GARGANTUATANTIAON (or however the fuck that's spelled). Just watched Deadfall last night and liked that word. Seriously though, so fucking pivotal. I see it. '180k years in the future will my actions, seeds planted, save the entire fucking existence of everything'. Ok maybe not that much lol but I like to fantacize about hypothetical maximums. Don't we all (you can do so infinitely btw, don't get too caught up with that or you'll waste your life away (you steven and you the reader (woot I have an audience.))


Corporate greed is taking over

I sound like such a hippy, even to myself, when I say that...


but it's still true~


capitalism: pokemon, marylin manson, sports

those are all 3 successful contributions to the world
HACKS.

fucking piss off and kill yourself


Capitalism encourages self centered behavior


and it... eats the scraps/remains (taxes and other side effects) of the results


entire fucking cities and states and countries live off those scraps. this is not logical.









.........all that being said, I do appreciate a good bootstrap :-P. I'm a hypocrite and I know it.
