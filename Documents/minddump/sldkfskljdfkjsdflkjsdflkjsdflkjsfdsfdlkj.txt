I have as much confidence in "them" "thawing me out" as I do in "them" "decrypting software drm". i'm not entirely sure the word software is relevant in that sentence. still, i believe the human body is a system and that on the scale of infinity it can and will be figured out
i think it is a mechanical/biochemical problem and it won't solve AI. It's of course possible that AI might need to be relied on for the thawing out and/or immortalizing. Who gives a shit, so long as it gets done.
