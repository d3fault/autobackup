Without love, life is futile. I had to look up that word to make sure it meant what I wanted it to mean. If I had to add a variant of it (choosing from only 5 alternate descriptions (synonyms?) in the dictionary), I'd choose "fruitless". Yes that's perfect actually. Life without love is like a strawberry plan with no strawberries. Sure, it's still a plant and it can grow and be magnificent... but without the strawberries the plant is surely missing something that would otherwise change the [observer (who? what? wtf?)]'s perspective on the plant as a whole. I guess in this analogy, the plant is observing itself. I am the plant.
