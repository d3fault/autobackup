I feel like a sixth of me is dead. It makes me want to procreate because eventually (incl. if i convince the other 4 to freeze themselves) I'll be the only one left. Selfishly, I want to start a family so that when I'm an old geezer... I'm not here all alone...

Oh sure siblings and other relatives... but meh YOU'RE RUINING MY POETIC WRITINGS, LOGIC. FUCK OFF!
