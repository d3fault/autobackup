i just watched kaylee's fb post 'the head the the heart - honey come home -
cardinal sessions'


well yea i am choosing to intepret that as hope
i don't care if it's false
considering she already said no
but i don't think she meant it
or.. i don't think 'cousin' is a strong enough reason
her dam may have burst
'cousin' is not strong enough to hold that logic

regardless, and back to the point
i chose to accept it and felt a flood of motivation for coding
that's the purpose i am choosing to, even if erroneously, interpret the video
as hope. she wants to die with the one she loves (so do i). i am the one she
loves

true?
who knows. who cares (i mean i do but yea~)
false? maybe, possibly. probably.
