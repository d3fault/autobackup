I was thinking about how and whether or not to modify my life so as to be safer etc... and the answer I gave myself when dealing with how to make decisions is: be realistic.

Realistic is such a shit word, but it is also the best fitting word. It is relative and requires perspective. It is also subjective. Robots cannot, by definition, have human relativity.

The copyright system is real politicians are real etc etc so on and so forth inserting shit tons of theories about death and/or "buy guys" who might otherwise ruin/prematurely-end your life.

My "realistic" module is telling me I shouldn't even be writing this doc. I mean, I shouldn't write what I'm about to write. But am I going to write it? Will I write it?

Meh I guess not. I guess I'm too much of a bitch to write. I need conclusions man. I need confidence. I can't just "bitch out from writing it" because then I counter myself with "do it just to prove you aren't a bitch" etc. I know I could write it and I do wonder "what's the big deal"... but

ok here's a freebie/hint: it's relating to an image or series of images that I sort of wish I never took (and am contemplating deleting). shit now at the very least someone can be all like "what were THEY?". 'they' is now defined [in that context].

... but I don't know if I should. This decision which will be carried out from here on is also a retroactive decision btw. It is a filter installation on my LifeShaper. The filter is mental but has a corresponding button with what to do with items that get filtered. The filter itself can have a place in the GUI just as a reminder, but it does seem safer to not be in the GUI at all and just be on a piece of paper that is later burned. These filters of course are more like 'categories' or even 'thresholds'. They are arbitrary and subjective to me. It is my life that is being shaped, after all.
