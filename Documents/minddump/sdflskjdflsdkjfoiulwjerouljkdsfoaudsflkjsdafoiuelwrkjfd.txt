When I think long and hard about what I am... and I take the human element out of it... I reach a plateu that is a sense of one. Or NOTHING, if you will. The paper flattened out. My mind... runs out of questions...


I open my eyes and am flooded with euphoria and endorphins. I feel them travelling throughout my body. "Feels" good man.




Certainly took a while for me to be able to even reach that plateu (state of consciousness?)... felt like I just connected the dependent points of logic not too long ago. It's an interesting place. I'd like to try dancing there.






Holy shit can't wait for my next 5-MEO-DMT trip............. I'll probably get there within seconds. The entire trip will take place in there. Kinda reminds me of the Matrix "white room" type shit... except with no floor no nothing (and certainly no humans).



I'll still want to keep my eyes open during that 5meo trip.... otherwise I might become ridiculously depressed at the nothingness of it all.


I say nothing but I don't mean nothing... I just mean.......... everything balances out mathematically in the end....


Does it balance out to 0 or 1?

I.....



have no idea.




When I say everything cancels out, then it should come back to zero. But then what/where/how do we come about? Makes no sense. We must be a slip where we are on the side of the 1 and the -1 is negative energy or whatever. IDFK. Fuck it.
