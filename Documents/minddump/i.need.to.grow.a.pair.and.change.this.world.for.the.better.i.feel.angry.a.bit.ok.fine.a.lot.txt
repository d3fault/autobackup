WHAT EVIL HAVE I DONE?
i scream at a judge convicting me of a non-evil crime (drugs most likely)
i have the right to try everything in this world that isn't evil
you do not have the power to restrain me

thought started watching s07e06 of peep show
'the room'
i would want to go in tripping balls
i just want to experience it
it's all your imagination of course
that room is
they never said what was in it
but i pictured myself losing it in there
and while tripping/losing it, i accidentally out myself as 'gay'
except i'm not gay
even while tripping balls i never admit it (shit's a truth syrum)
i say: 'i just want to try everything in this world at least once'

you are the insane
you delusional beings
and you come at me and restrain ME?
it's well within my right to meet you with violent force
that's how we deal with the insane, isn't it?

it's how you do too
