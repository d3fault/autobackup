Good dubstep makes me cry (yes, crying right now listening to "ellie goulding - lights (bassnectar remix)"). It might be because I'm not making music like I want to be, or maybe the relative sensory deprivation (I.......), or maybe just somehow gets me thinking about the sadness of the world. I dunno.
