Love is meant for two.

Love is a metaphorical orb between you and another person. You put 50% of your love into it (the other 50%, you give to yourself). That orb is like a fucking scrambler/amplifier/etc. Since you are not your lover, you experience the 50% that they put in differently from how they expect you to (sometimes better, sometimes worse). That difference is probably the chaotic kindle of intelligence itself. Love comes way before speaking or even the human species.

Giving yourself 100% does not give you undefined results (in this case, undefined results are very good).

More than two means it's very unlikely that there's an even 1/3 (if 3 for example) split. Someone is bound to get less than what they put in. If you ever don't get 100% after the maths, you end up hating your situation (well I mean not always, but it's more likely I suppose).
