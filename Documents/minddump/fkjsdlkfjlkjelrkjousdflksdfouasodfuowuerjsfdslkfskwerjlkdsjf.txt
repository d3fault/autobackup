A man wakes up while laying in the middle of a city, starts screaming at the top of his lungs because of what he sees/understands around him. After ample screaming, he begins muttering the phrase "too soon" senselessly to himself. He holds himself/his-arms and, with his head down (but so low enough that he can't make eye contact with his peers), backs away from everyone around him in sheer terror, trying to find the safe corner that isn't there. He runs to the nearest cryonics facility and jumps back in.


This is me, but I'm living this life instead because I don't have any assurance that frozing will work (despite a ton of logical 'evidence' that infinite multiverse theory is true (which in turn means that frozing will work (don't have to live in universes where it doesn't))).


Frozing is arguably SAFER because you don't run the risk of pissing off some idiot who in turn kills you.


I'm just BARELY lacking enough evidence/confidence to freeze myself now. Not frozing could be a fatal decision (and of course, the opposite it true too. fuck).
