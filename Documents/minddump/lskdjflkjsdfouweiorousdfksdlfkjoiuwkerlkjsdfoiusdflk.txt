I feel the gravity for the first time. When I stare at myself in the mirror I see a different person. Steven no longer exists (loljk but you know what I mean...). I see a confident man (who is pissed that he's been so slow). I see a human. I feel good because I am good. I don't think I'll censor a single thing: I can throw apologies and explainations left and right without giving a shit. Probably NOT doing shredbox, but a little uncertain of that. Drawing that comic yesterday ("NOW"/"THEN") was awesome because it was essentially a "plan". It is just that it also has entertainment and lol value. Fuck this Rpc Generator... I want it to be done so I can start driving the fucking tractor and piling dirt. That dirt code is going to be so much easier by comparison. I hope to and intend on flying through it. This is exhilerating. This is real life. This is a life NOT wasted.
