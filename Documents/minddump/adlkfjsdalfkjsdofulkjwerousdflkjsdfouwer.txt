watching disney movies (watching jungle book right now) makes me want to be like walt. he has such huge influence on the world. he has influenced my own life tremendously, just because i grew up around them. disney classics are the best. new disney is shit. probably because walt isn't involved. not probably, definitely. make sure d3fault doesn't get bastardized in the same way. you ARE d3fault. i guess he WAS disney... but eh he corporatized it in a manner i do not desire.

video games sound more fun anyways, but just like the appeal to children (which will be weird considering most of my content will NOT be targetted to children (subsidiary = win)) and innocence and creativity behind it all is what fascinates me. break into song that is both amusing and a life lesson (even if you have to be an adult re-watching it to get it (that shit soaks into your subconscious regardless of whether you explicitly understand it))
