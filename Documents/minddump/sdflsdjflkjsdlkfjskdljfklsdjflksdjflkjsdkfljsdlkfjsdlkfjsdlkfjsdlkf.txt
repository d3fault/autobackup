Ignoring politics outright is the only way I can refrain from being a serial killer.


The most difficult question everybody has to answer: Do I love life so much that I don't want to waste it in politics, or do I love life so much that I can't afford to not get involved in politics.

The question is timeless, but the answer depends on the era/geography of your birth.

I think I've made up my mind FINALLY: This existence is fucked. Evil is winning (but that doesn't mean I'll be evil). Evil has a firm grip on US&A and won't let go without a fight to the death. Evil makes the rules/definitions and defines itself as "legal and not evil".


Fuck history, I'll stick with codan. History is bullshit. Winners of war write history with extreme bias. How do I honestly know Hitler wasn't trying to combat evil taking over the whole world (as is now)? I wasn't there, and I don't trust history, so.... ???

(obviously hitler is the extreme example since he's classic 'evil')


He who spends his entire life studying history, lives not. The key is to make history. Sure "you're doomed to repeat it", but history's all a crock of shit anyways.... and IMT is true too.... so if you have a problem with repeating then kill yourself (oh wait that would be a repeat too ;-P (but at least you wouldn't have to deal with it)).
