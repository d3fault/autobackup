I wonder if I can sleep dance. Cam on ceiling filming me sleep, and I start flaling/dancing on my bed because I'm dancing in a dream. Would be cool if I remembered the dream, would be interesting if it was lucid/chosen. I don't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Same with sleep talking (have already programmed + unprogrammed my brain to do it).
