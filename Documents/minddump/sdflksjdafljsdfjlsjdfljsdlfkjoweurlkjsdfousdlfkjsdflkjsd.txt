Re: love is meant for two.
Forgot to mention a pretty important part. Cheating hurts so much because you realize that you haven't been getting 100%. You're literally cheated out of life itself. Just as data loss is gutwrenching to me because the time spent creating it is now poof gone vanished, time in a relationship is equally removed.
