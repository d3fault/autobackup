to say "fuck kaylee i won't ask her if she wants to be censored because she won't talk to me" isn't exactly fair because this is the rest of her life we're talking about...

still... i actually think she'd say "ok"



....but i don't like that i'd have to tell her "i'm releasing a book (before actually releasing said book)" in order to ask her if she wants to be censored


when i launch, i don't plan on publishing anywhere


MAYBE one /b/ post

but eh it'd be cooler if it was 100% word of mouth..

...but i could also go days/weeks (MAYBE months) without a single visitor rofl

who cares if i've cut off all input? which i think i'll do at least for a little bit. playing that part by ear. "however much i want"
