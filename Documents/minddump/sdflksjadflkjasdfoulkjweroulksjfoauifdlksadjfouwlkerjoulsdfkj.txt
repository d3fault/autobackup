A cludgeon(sp?) of meat. An onion with billions of layers (genetic features). Food was likely first and sex/self-cloning was likely second. Each new feature is [usually] simply "that which is least likely to not appear"... and of course there is luck thrown in (hence:usually). Aliens would likely resemble us in some ways because of that. Random features that don't affect the course of natural selection will be the major differences.

We start off as just "stuff" that eats other "stuff" with no emotion or thought... until eventually there is. And then we go on to to question "Why are we here?". There is absolutely no reason. We just are. In fact, we also can't not be. The trillions of years in between life (more specicially: self aware life) emergences go unnoticed.

When you just are, in that way, it helps a bit with your [programmed] fear of death. Emotion clouds your judgement and makes you (us) feel special. We're just confused machines. Well I mean I don't think I'm confused anymore... (therefore I'm not)... but my peers/ancestors certainly are/were.
