Dancing may be fun, but I think it's actually quite limited. I can rotate my arms like a windmill and do similar with my legs, and I have shown the range for which I can manipulate my limbs. Sure there's still a lot of room for choreography (and technically there are even infinite movements from within that space), but I feel much more.... free.... in the realm of speaking/thinking/programming. There is much more "space" to do stuff in. I am a physical representation. My human body is a vessel to my mind. My human body is limited in what it can do. It can only do human functions. There isn't a human function that pretty much every human could do (excluding double jointed etc) with a bit of practice. Thoughts are completely different, however. No two people (brains/minds) are even remotely alike, whereas pretty much every human body is relatively similar.
