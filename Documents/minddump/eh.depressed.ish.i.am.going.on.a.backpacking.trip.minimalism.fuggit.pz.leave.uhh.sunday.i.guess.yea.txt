I feel like shit.
Probably the worst feeling I've ever had.
It's all mental. Physically I am fine.


I have created my own version of hell.

-No money
-No social interactions, stay in my fuckin cooped up room all day every day. It's by choice but still depressing~
-Verbally dominant father won't let me speak my mind. He jumps to yelling and "kicking me out" within seconds of the first disagreement (about anything)
-Caydon comes over every fucking day. I like him as a whole but I hate the impending "he's coming" feeling. And yea, he can be a whiny fucking baby sometimes
-I am sitting on a wealth of knowledge that is my retirement
-I am sitting on ideas to give myself bliss
-I am forced to trust the Qt Security Team with ABC etc -_-
-I am 99% sure I'm being spied on / ripped off. STOP TALKING SO FUCKING MUCH IDIOT
-Kaylee won't say a word to me [except at 'family events', but it's always just small talk :(]
-Re: that wealth of knowledge. I am stressed out by it's security. Not just with keeping others out, but also just keeping it all from falling apart. Bit rot, typos in scripts, VIBRATIONS, etc.
-Constantly nagged/bothered by inferiors. I have no accomplishments thus no response
-I feel like this will never end. I feel like the now is indefinite (THIS IS FALSE. I AM ACTIVELY MAKING IT FALSE. FUCK YOU REALITY, YOU ARE MY BITCH)
-Barely enough food to survive on. Well, not really. Just shitty food I guess I should say. I am losing weight though. 118 and dropping(?). Compared to ethiopians I have nothing to complain about. In fact I'm quite spoiled
-Can't fulfill my sex addiction. Sex is maintenance ~_~. Masturbation only holds me off for so long
-Contradictions in my brain, as well as basically just pulling me in so many different directions. ONE EXAMPLE: Carpe diem vs. You're being spied on STFU. ANOTHER: QuickDirtyBackup[etc] vs. d3fault
-No drugs, but this really falls under no money


I think that's about it. Pretty damn long list if you ask me. Tbh I feel better just conceptuatlizing my problems like that. Writing them out has relieved the feeling A BIT. Oh lol forgot one ;-):

-Complicated headache of actually creating ABC




So shit this idea just came to me a bit ago: I think I'm going to go backpacking alone. No fucking phone (though I might borrow it's microSD card since the 1gb I have is too small... but then I'll be too afraid to put it back in?????). The weather during this time of year is decent. Getting colder and colder but eh pants and sweatshirts and I should be ok. Also that amazing sleeping bag and lightweight tent I have. I remember I was planning similar a year or two ago.. but now I think I need it. Well just want it more. KISS though. Ramen, canned food, lots of water... fire utility... batteries for microphone... and honestly that's about it. Oh and compass / map. Fuck phone. I guess I could take it with the battery removed as a safety precaution... but I still hate it overall. I don't have a destination, nor do I need one. Every direction is NOBODY. That's what I want right now. NOBODY. NOTHING. ME MY BRAIN AND MY MICROPHONE. I am my brain. However I guess I mean my physical body vs. my 'soul'/conscience? idfk. Word would also travel to Kaylee I bet and it'd get in her head. JUST SAYIN. I'm doing this for me, but if it manipulates her (guilt) as a side-effect: fuck it.


I like this idea quite much. Just need to sync my 2x1tb drives again and I'd feel comfortable enough doing it. Static backups are pretty damn easy... just a bit time consuming.


I need to get away. There's nobody (well, ALMOST nobody ;-)) I want to talk to right now. What if I die out there? What if I die in here?
