Eureka: logic.
I'm hesitant to move forwards because I don't want to hurt others around me. Survival in general, and additionally the free market in all it's excessive glory, requires me to hurt others around me. So it's me or them, and like everybody I'll choose me. Yes yes double back and try to fix the problem (don't forget ;-P), but "I can't save the world BEFORE I move out".


Thinking about Caydon specifically, I think I'll help him out by moving forward. Show him how to fucking live (I'm a shit example of it presently). I know he's in a weird arbitrary hell living with my sister. It's when I consider many many people around me that I ponder of harm coming to them. It was the scattered responses that made me realize the above paragraph. Loved ones are just peers too.


I'm not sure what kind of launch I'll have, might not be live at first, idgaf. I just want to be public.
