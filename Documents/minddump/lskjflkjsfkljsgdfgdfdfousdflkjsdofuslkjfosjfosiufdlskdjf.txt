I asked myself: "which is more likely to happen first: suicide from boredom or finding/waiting-for an alien species?"

Since life does not occur at a constant interval but is in fact variable, the question becomes: Is there a higher probability that aliens are discovered before I/we suicide from boredom or after?

The answer is after (excusing the error in my writing (can't discover aliens when dead xD)), aka never. The reason is because if you choose any finite set on the scale of infinity... such as how long you think you can tolerate the boredom before you reset... on the other half of that finite set ('afterwards') is still infinity... which makes the probability that you discover aliens before you suicide from boredom approach (essentially) zero.

Life is that rare. Take any finite set and it is extremely unlikely to occur. On any finite set, the probability of life occuring approaches zero. On an infinite set, the probability of life occuring is 1.

For this reason, I highly doubt we'll ever discover aliens (either younger or older than us). I would love to be wrong (as my dream last night demonstrated :-P).
