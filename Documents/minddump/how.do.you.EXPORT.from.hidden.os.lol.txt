ehh... when in hidden OS mode truecrypt mounts every non-hidden partition as read only... so i have to make a new/fake hidden drive to trick truecrypt into writing to it... then mount that in a non-hidden OS, then copy it's contents out, then mount my regular truecrypt volume on my 1tb, then copy the file there. FUCK MY LIFE. and i guess to get the security back i have to shred the contents of the thumb drive? so much work... i really wish i could override truecrypt here... they explain how to IMPORT files from other filesystems... but that's not the problem. that's fucking easy when everything is readonly.
