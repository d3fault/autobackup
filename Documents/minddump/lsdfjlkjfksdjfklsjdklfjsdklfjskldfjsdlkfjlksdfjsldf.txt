"I doubt there's a universe where we waited long enough to meet another life form that has emerged. an intelligent one that is" -me now
^i'm sure that's not impossible, therefore since there is infinite time it has definitely occurred. certainly not to say it is occuring now (but who knows).

still, i think it would be a rare occurance to discover another life form. my reasoning is that we underappreciate the amount time involved for an intelligent life form to emerge by sheer chance. I think it is beyond fathomable amounts of orders of magnitutdes more time than "15 billion earth years", which is as long as it took to occur in this big bang instance.

Every one of us inevitebly commits suicide or hell maybe we don't escape the giant collapse.


The epoch should be since the big bang. Although sure you save some bits by making it 1970, extremely previous dates could use word interpretation to make up for it.
