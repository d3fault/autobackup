You plateau on a grassy field from underground, after the conscience in a void, and you see all your opportunities around you. You know you could follow any one of them infinitely (quantum boredom (tm) problem aside), and you caution yourself of that: "choose your battles wisely, for the very one that chaos presents to you could take up the entire duration of your life".

On the flip side, not walking down any of those paths/directions and just sitting there, in that grassy field, looking at all the opportunity and unable to decide, is even worse. You can choose one direction and pursue it indefinitely, or you can choose many and balance them arbitrarily... but choose.


"The only wrong answer is to choose to sit there (or to not choose, sameshit)" <-- UNLESS we are missing knowledge that says: "wait. protect life ultra paranoid mod etc until X comes around and you can have free will AND safety" (brain in a vat mb?).


I am biased towards saying "go for it bro go all out etc woo" because I know that I have nothing, no 'products' I am ready to 'sell', if I do decide to play the conservative route. Oh sure I have many plans and ideas and enough (had:much) ability (by Earth 2013 standards)... but I'd still have a pretty long way to go from here. Launch, throw my nuts at the fucking wall, is much closer (and will work, financially).

Rpc Generator was definitely a stupid premature optimization (I'm glad I'm not working on it anymore (although blankety blank blank blankenblank)).
Rpc Generator is(had:was) definitely a fucking pro ass design / application.
