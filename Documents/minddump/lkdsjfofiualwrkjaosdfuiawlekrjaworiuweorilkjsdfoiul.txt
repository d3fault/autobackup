considering a lot of my ideas are to compete with large corporations (google, etc)
being an unknown would mean that if I were to publish my ideas, Google etc would be able to rip me off

I need a voice and a company (though I don't plan on having any employees)

I want to call Google out for being evil, because I believe they are... even if unintentionally.

I am not afraid of death
ok that's a lie
but it's coming no matter what-
