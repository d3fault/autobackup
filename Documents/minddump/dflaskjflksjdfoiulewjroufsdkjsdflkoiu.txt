Sensory Deprivation and/or self inflicted "pain" (BDSM etc) are the only way to counter-balance the sheer bliss and pleasures of life. Too much of one or the other and you lose perspective of whatever it is you are feeling. Toggle dat shit at will and on a whim: mb 50/50 is a nice ratio (automate it?), but whim and will should certainly factor in. A tiny bit of pain can easily put an enormous amount of bliss back into perspective. Maybe that is the only reason pain exists (OK, it isn't: pain is used as a survival mechanism)
