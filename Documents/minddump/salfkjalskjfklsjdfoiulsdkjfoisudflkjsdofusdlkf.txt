I'm using macros because inline functions must go in header, and DPL/LGPL practically puts header in public domain...... but lolfully my macros are going in the headers still xD.

HOWEVER the point here still remains, guh mah license is getting in mah way, mb I should GPL for this reason (very weak argument). I've been reading a tiny tiny bit of JSF++ in my spare time (code for work, read about code for hobby) and yea the soup makes strong arguments toward inlining, but guh......
..... aww fuck it i'll just never inline :)..... doesn't compiler do it lots anyways? idfk...
