That "revolution" I wrote about was more of a mental revolution. Sure, there will be the described court case. It will be big (covered in the news etc (or maybe censored ;-P)) and I will win... but it definitely isn't as big as I was making it out to be. Now that I've processed the logic I am living as if I have already won. I know I will so fuck it. LAUNCH is on and I don't feel like I've ever been more devoted/committed/dedicated/FAST as I have been now. All I do is stare at my desktop until I know what to do next to get there. I also write docs if I think of them. I am putting emphasis on code though :-P, I need to launch because this proprietary life sucks. We are born into a proprietary, secretive, media-driven/controlled, private life... by default. A goal (I would have tackled in lolitics) is that we are born into libre by default.

I don't believe it's a conspiracy (but it COULD be). I believe we humans are young and therefore stupid. We have created a paranoia-inducing reality on accident.
