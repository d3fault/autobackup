"heart of works" solved(??? (no case law sadface))
DPL = LGPL sans GPL virus
"the work linked-to (heart of works in that one reference case) RETAINS it's libre status, the surrounding/embodying works is licensed however"


I don't care if you fuck me in the ass.
I don't care if you fuck me in the vagina.

So long as the original works retains it's libre status, I don't care HOW it's used. GPL/'Free' puts restrictions on how it's used, which limits it's exposure.


DPL is playing with exponents. The exponential increase in exposure (business peoples) more than makes up for [something goes here I can't write for shit]
