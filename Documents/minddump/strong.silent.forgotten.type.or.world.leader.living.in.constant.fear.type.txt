Peter Sunde's video i just watched a bit ago about 'being a bank' if you use bitcoin and all the legal complications it brings really makes me worry about my decision to go public
i could, under the same configuration, be anonymous. just like Satoshi

or I could embrace it and leverage it into a "political" (except non-US imo) position. worldwide more like it
I'd have to address the problem of tax
that much is certain
but i guess i'd eventually stop paying the US government for taxes and start using my [to be invented] government system
the initial/only reason i'd want to pay the US gov't is to keep them off my back and keep myself out of prison
but once a more elegant solution (corruption free!) is invented, switch to that

should i hide in the shadows all my life?
'strong, silent type'
or should i be [or attempt to be] a world leader?
which will get you a better name in the history books?
which is more likely to land you in prison (or dead)?

the strong silent type is most likely to leave me forgotten (data purge etc?)
someone could somewhat-easily fuck me over
steal my ideas and use them in world leader capacity

so in that respect, it is my duty to be a world leader?
hmmmmm....
