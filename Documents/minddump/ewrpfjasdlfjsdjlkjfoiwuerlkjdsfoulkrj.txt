I think that's my strongest argument for it. My "musically inspired" "thoughts recordings" are, in nature, a transformative works. NOT derivative.


They are derivative in the strictest sense of deriving (all thought is a derivative of other thought), but NOT in the legal definition of "derivative". I am not remixing the music, nor adding to it, etc. It's just THERE in the BACKGROUND to INSPIRE _THOUGHT_ (the new work).


Would definitely be a hugely popular/expensive case and I genuinely have no clue which way it would go...
