That we are irrational when we are angry and yet it might be justified (almost wrote rational) to be angry in order to vent.

There is a huge contradiction that I keep wanting to bring up. I support people being mean and yet I "criticize"/shame(?) (lolololololololololol) him for being mean. I can't simultaneously support free will so long as not doing harm and shame him at the same time, which I am currently doing now. Shaming him by merely disapproving of his ways (which is necessary for (...)) is contradicting supporting being mean.
