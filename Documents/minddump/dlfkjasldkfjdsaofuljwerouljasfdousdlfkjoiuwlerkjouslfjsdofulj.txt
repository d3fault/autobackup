Man I can't wait for designEquals controlled by fingers and some retarded ass auto-tune-music coming out of the fingers usage of designEquals. Even if the music sounds mostly shit it'll be fun as fuck. I guess you could call that a "goal"... but I have lots of "software" goals really. I just acknowledge that none of them are accomplishments of any kind... so it kinda depends on how you define a goal heh...
