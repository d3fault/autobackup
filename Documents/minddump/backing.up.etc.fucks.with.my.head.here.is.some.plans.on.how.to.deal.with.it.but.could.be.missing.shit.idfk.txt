ahh i think i remember now

it was my description of the merging

but also cognitive dissonance on if i should even head that direction atm

should i stick with static backup method?

wrote this then left it open and played solitaire and wrote a few other docs in between

but i'm sure you can match what it goes with ;-P


anyways

multiple sources (1tbx1, 1tbx2)
multiple destinations (750x1, 750x2... and then later 1tbx1 and 1tbx2 again (after formatting / changing keys))

hashes from sources have to be checked
timestamps too
i should choose which of the two conflicts to use (unless only difference is timestamps, in which case it chooses earlier one)
it should be fail proof in case hashing algorithm uses all my memory or i fail for some other reason
i guess it should just work on large files in general. should test that before trying to use it

see now i already forgot the rest


i like the idea of an index keeping the timestamps + filenames
but i want that index to be incremental

and like in chunks also

so i can update it incrementally every time i save (750s etc)
and i can increment it every time i connect 1tbs


fuckin a so complicated

but i do think i only ever need to use it once

i just need to organize it better in the future

right now i feel so fucking messy

it's messing with my head


i also want to minimize it

get rid of [most] movies
games too

make my shit fit on whatever

aside: also make minimal minimal (maybe just without vids i've made?) of text (code too) + pictures on a dual layer dvd-r
MAGNET PROOF

fucking breaking bad scared the shit out of me

text + code + pictures are most valuable to me

videos follow directly after

then the timestamps for all of the above


then.........

well that's it

don't care that much about keeping tv shows + movies + games etc...

but that dual layer dvd-r is a tangent worth exploring
sort of like static backup mode :-P
but magnet proof

and i want to hide multiple copies all around
etc
