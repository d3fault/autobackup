Toolkits/Frameworks (Qt API implemented using Boost), AV Libs (minimal FFmpeg clone supporting vp9/opus/theora/other-compatible(keep-readan)), and Operating Systems (OpenBSD), should all be licensed under BSD-esq (ISC idc) licenses. The rest of the softwares (like, tools using those libs, etc) should be DPL (but that's just like, my opinion, man). Those 3 categories of software are used by tons of people and it's to everyone's benefit to not have to reinvent the wheel. Kind of like how RMS says libc needs to be licensed under LGPL in order to stay relevant and/or compete, I'm saying the same thing about those 3 software categories (but I'm loosening the licencing noose even further than RMS).
