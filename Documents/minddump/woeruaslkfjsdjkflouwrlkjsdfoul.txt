trying to find the perfect way to live (trying to plan it) is like trying to find the perfect gear on a mountain bike for every kind of terrain: it's just stupid
you cannot predict what terrain you will encounter out on the road, but you can shift gears at will
so long as you have your gears (your ability to TRY HARDER or TRY LESS) and free will, you'll just have to handle each event as it happens
a starting gear is still of importance: "right smack dab in the middle" <- o look i'm trying to figure out "perfect" again
just fucking GO
like trying to calculate max's and min's: what you start with doesn't matter that much (start low when finding max's, start high when finding lows ...... OR just set max to be the first number you encounter (etc))
you can adjust once you are going
when something is difficult you can switch to a lower gear and analyze the fuck out of it
but when shit's easy you switch to a higher gear (this includes outsourcing) and blow through it
the key is to go


i feel like i'm working on my bike in my garage still
i feel like a coiled up spring that has practically been coiled up as far as it can go
i'm adjusting the angle to launch it and making sure there's no blockages in the tube and yada yada yada
