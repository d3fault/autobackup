We are always in our final drug trip because life is finite and so is the final drug trip. Life is constantly collapsing. It's the terrible tragedy of life, but knowing that the atoms will bounce back into life is somewhat comforting.

As soon as life emerges it is also falling apart. There is no difference. We are always in the arrangement of it existing because we are unable to analyze ourselves when it doesn't.

So basically, savor the moment. You've savored it before and you'll savor it again... but don't worry about those times... only worry about now. Put all of your energy into enjoying NOW. Plan ahead a bit (and learn from the past a bit), but don't get too fucking far ahead of yourself like I have/do.
