To clarify, I won't hold it against someone who, when they aren't around me, acknowledges and lives in that proprietary insanity. It's a personal/singular choice: my choice. Fuck that system of insanity, I want nothing to do with it. I won't try to pressure (hopefully, call me out if I do) anyone into not embracing proprietary bullshit, but I'll _INSIST_ that they not mention it in my own presence. My ears, my brain, my sanity. I won't have any legal recourse or even get angry (well maybe a touch ;-P) if they break my rule, I'll just then not hang out with them (maybe a few warnings etc (warnings = pressure? yes, but justified (i don't care what they do when not in my presence is the point of the not wanting to pressure))).
