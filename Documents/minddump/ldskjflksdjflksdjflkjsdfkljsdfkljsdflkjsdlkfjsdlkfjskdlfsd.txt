I want to work on d=i and Osios because holy shit both projects are so fucking awesome, but I _SHOULD_ work on Abc2 because fuck my life I hate living at home as a broke ass nigga.

I love knowing I "have an ad agency" though. I think about putting ads in d=i and Osios (settings menus only (and of course their site where you dl from)? maybe show on "update to newest version" progress dialog as well. pretty damn sure I don't want to show ads at all times... as that would be fucking stupid especially if open source lol (fork'd immediately)). I think about ads in lots of projects, I could just be a serial project maker (games, db shit, dumb sites), and Abc2 could be the core business aspect behind all of them. In all honesty though, I'd rather launch. Secrets are rotting my brain man.

It excites me to think that once launched, d=i and Osios could be the only thing I focus on (well I'd probably throw fingers into the mix ;-P)
