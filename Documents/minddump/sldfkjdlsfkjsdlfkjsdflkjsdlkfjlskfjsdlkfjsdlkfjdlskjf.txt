leap seconds, that time "goes backwards" (in unixtime at least) could still cause us to overwrite (our overwrite protection file (so yes we'd need to overwrite twice)) <-- but if you are relying (only) on time like that for your [initial] writes in the first place, you're doing it wrong. two successive calls to get unix time might return the same value (actually, they probably will because CPUs are so much faster than the precision an int64 can represent (number of milliseconds since epoch). actually I'm not so sure my claim is valid, but I would say that you (probably?) need more than millisecond precision to measure a cpu (unless you do your test(s) over and over countless times in a loop). blah the point is I still worry that I'm going to overwrite shit with that. mb I should factor in an RNG for the --suffix? like: --suffix="$(date +%s)" + "$(cat /dev/rand | base64)" #idfk how to combine two strings in bash (that plus probably won't work), so this is pseudo. also want to cut off the cat /dev/rand after just like 8 bytes or whatever
