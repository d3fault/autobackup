Calm until fingers, calm until fingers.

Just concluded: sober until fingers.

I need a reason (A VISIBLE REASON, THAT IS ;-P) to flip out and go apeshit with excitement, otherwise they may very well lock me up. Alpha fingers is that reason. Don't give a fuck if it sounds like shit. As soon as I'm pumping raw bytes out of my speakers controlled via 10 fingers, I'm dosing and [very likely] rolling around like a loon (had:loony).
