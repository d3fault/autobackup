"presidentialQassert" is analogically equivalent to "if I were to ride in a rocket to mars, I had better declare it so as not to be erroneously considered a hostile threat (had:thread (ROFL)) and be shot down by defenders"

I had better declare my launch schedule, that is.

Or do you have to ask permission?
I think it is philisophically wrong to have to ask permission. There is nobody to ask permission from. We are all just an evolving web of tricksters. Each chaotically attempting to trick those who are (had:whore) geographically placed nearby (worth mentioning that their geographic placement is random on a (or in a) something-goes-here).

random on a different seed. on a different psuedocrytographograndoerrimeanrandographic so pseudocrytorandographic. on a different pseudocrytorandographic level.


The randomness is akin to what is achieved by our dna frame shift error
