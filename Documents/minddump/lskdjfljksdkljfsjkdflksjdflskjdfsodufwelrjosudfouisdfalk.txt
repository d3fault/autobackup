Any genius can be bested singularly by almost any idiot. If you devote your energy into making someone look stupid just once (well, you're stupid for aiming your energy at such things first of all), you will undoubtedly succeed. Bill O'Reilly could out-debate Albert Einstein any day of the week (if you consider cutting your opponent's mic a respectable (had:viable) tactic).
