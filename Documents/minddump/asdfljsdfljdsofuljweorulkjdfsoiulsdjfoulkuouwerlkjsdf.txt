Life, Love, in it's most primal form (sex), is the emergence accidentally of "2 (3?) birds with one stone". 1 = sex itself, 2 & 3 are the pleasure factor for each partner. From then on, self-centered'ness fuels evolution.

You are soft and pleasureless during sex initially. It is reflexive/impulsive/instinctive. You likely don't even feel the orgasm until... you do (until one in the chain of offspring evolves pleasurable sex). This obviously isn't the beginning or end, but it's a... data point. Also it could even be backwards: pleasure before reproductivity, though I doubt it (how do you continue to exist if you can't reproduce?).

That data point just signals an... order of magnitude... increase in the... rate at which we evolve.


In what species does it occur? Human? I remember hearing randomly somehwere that "we and dolphins are only creatures that fuck for fun" or some shit... but honestly I doubt that. Or at the very least, I doubt that other higher up animals don't get pleasure out of sex (even if it is "just" for reproduction). I call bullshit on that because the animals have no idea what it's for. They do it instinctively, not for pleasure or for reproduction [at first].



Err, leik dis prolly:

Do it on accident and reproduction emerges (lots of times)
Do it on accident and reproduction emerges and is passed along (fewer times)
Do it on accident and pleasure emerges (lots of times (at this point, "pass along"-ness has already been introduced))
Do it on purpose and evolve random features over and over accidentally

Natural Selection kicks in and bam we're fucking humans after a deal of time (the emergence of the conscience is not dealt with here)
