The criminal organization in charge of the "protection racket" is the real government for a place and time. Government tries to be "official". It follows strict rules to try to be good and just. It handicaps itself greatly in doing so. The mere fact that organized crime still exists today serves as [weak] evidence (had:proof) that it cannot be contained; the ['official'] government can't stop it.

I was thinking about how it's lose/lose. How life is lose/lose. They approach you to offer "protection", and it's lose/lose from there. You refuse and your life becomes hell, you agree and you are their bitch, more or less.

Oh also it's lose/lose/lose for me, living a private/encrypted life IS a way to evade the protection racket, but still you are reacting to them and living your life in hiding (which is no way to live at all) because of them.

I felt extremely depressed when I realized it's lose/lose/lose the other day. I felt depressed until I changed my definition of government. The only thing that separates official government from organized crime is that official government declares itself officially valid and writes it down and refers to those writings to validate itself. Also organized crime has a much harsher punishment system (and a shitty pension plan) xD.

Whatever, my redefining of "organized crime" into "unofficial government" helps me cope. Protection fee is just the same as a tax. It's a tax to exist. Fundamentally WRONG, but what the fuck are YOU going to do about it? I could devote my life to politics or organized crime in order to "make shit better", but I'd rather not because all the sideways backstabbing would make my life a living hell, zzzzz.

I pay a tax to the official government without feeling like I'm "their bitch", so I can pay another one using the same justification. Death and Taxes are certain for the time being.


Two taxes are the same as one, and a bit of cash is a small price to pay for the amazing life I'm going to live (tomorrow).
