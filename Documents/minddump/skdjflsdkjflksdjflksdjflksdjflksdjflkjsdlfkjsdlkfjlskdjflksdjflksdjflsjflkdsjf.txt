I feel like the main character of "Come and See" at the beginning of the movie: digging and just generally wasting his fucking time. Much later in my life, I'll see how stupid I was being and put my head in the dirt like an ostrige. I'm not able to see how stupid I'm being yet (although I already know I waste way too much fucking time). But really, what could the main character have done even if he had foresight? Run away? I don't think he could have prepared any better, so running was his only better option (but running is not really a good long term strategy for an evolved life form. at some point you must stand and fight). And there's also the fact that this is a fucking analogy and I don't know what "running" equates to for me here and now. I only know that I'm stupid LIKE him, not how I'm stupid. Maybe it's as simple as "enjoy it while it lasts" (bleh well fuck the constant chase of money doesn't allow me to. fuck).
