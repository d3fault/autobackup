I am but one line of exploration. We need to make a mesh/web/whatever, of which I am a single line. Whether I die or not (hopefully don't/not-soon), I am a single line either way. The collection of which represent the whole of human knowledge and it is imperitive that each can derive from all other. After many generations of collection, we will be able to analyze the mesh itself to notice abstract connections in it. This will overall improve the human intelligence as we have the capability of communicating abstract thought to one another. Someone simply has to notice and indicate the connection.
