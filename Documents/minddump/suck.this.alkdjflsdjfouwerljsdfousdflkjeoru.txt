it is impossible to simultaneously broadcast your actions live and to respond to CP and/or DMCA requests because responding to them means you cannot longer broadcast (else you'd be BROADCSTING (much worse because many more views AND you are the 'originator' of said broadcast so you have a legal obligation to NOT broadcast the images))

since it is well within my human rights to broadcast myself 24/7/365 libre-mode (out of a need for sanity)
therefore, i conveniently have an "aliby" (legit and easily verifiable one too!) for not responding to either of the two requests
CP is disgusting and i actually feel inclined to respond/forward them
DMCA notices i couldn't give a shit less because nobody is harmed
i have an alaby for both (or is it alabi? fuck it) and a legitimate actual reason behind it
i would argue with any judge that argues i should come out of 24/7/365 mode and i will win
otherwise, i kill myself (fuck prison)
i mean sure i'd wait a while to see if anything developed
but once i'm in for good: become an hero

i cannot also "hire people" to do cp/dmca deletion for me because then i am giving THOSE PEOPLE the direct ability to CENSOR me
as in, censor MY INPUT
i cannot have that
i especially will not pay for it
lastly, it would require interaction with another human being
i have the right to be left alone
it is not against the law to operate a business entirely by myself

asking me to respond to DMCA/cp is asking me to sacrifice MY TIME AND LIFE doing so


triangular/pyrimidal schemes where the cp/dmca takedown request is approved by marginally fewer and fewer (but more and more trusted) people (where i am the tippy top) are also impossible because of the inevitable chance that i am forced to view/broadcast an image to accept or decline it.
since i am legally responsible only i can make the "tough calls"
this is a contradiction of logic and would be thrown out of any court
else, i kill myself because the world proves itself illogical (why would i EVER want to live in such a place??? "my own version of hell" (apparently lots of people have said that... i probably ripped them off subconsciously))
