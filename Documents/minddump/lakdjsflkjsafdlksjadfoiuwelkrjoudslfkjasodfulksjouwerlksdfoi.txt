Life is more similar to Hedgewars than Chess. Hedgewars is chaotic. The best player doesn't always win. The second best player doesn't always win. I remember distinctly a match when I was just getting into the game: I was still shit. The best and second best players attacked only each other because they didn't fear me. At the end, I had a shit ton of players left and swept up the remains of the winner. I rubbed it in their face and lol'd because I knew I was shittier than both of them. Chess is a skill game. The best player almost always wins, unless an inferior player gets lucky and tricks the better player using a trick that, by sheer chance, the better play hadn't learned yet.
