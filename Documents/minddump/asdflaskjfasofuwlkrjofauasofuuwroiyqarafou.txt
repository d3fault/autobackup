i still don't know what to decide
but i guess that's my point:
DON'T WASTE TOO MUCH TIME DECIDING
there is no wrong answer

ok that's wrong
there is a wrong answer

but it's MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH worse to waste all your life deciding
pick and stick

or hell
pick and flip
flip flop
as many times as you want

who gives a fuck

give it some more thought
but if it doesn't just come to you naturally


come to think of it
i don't even know what i'm asking

i mean i SORT OF do

like... how much to censor?
how much to hide?

but i also don't want to hide anything
100% truth means my past as well

but
does not mentioning certain things count towards distruth?

what about changing names?
other peoples, not mine lol

(aside: i kinda wanna change my name to d3fault)


so i'm deciding on if my decision of 100% truth should be stuck with?
even though i've already decided it should?

so does that just mean i'm afraid of forging forward??

tick tock motherfucker
you're wasting it.
