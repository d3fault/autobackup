i need to launch
and i was thinking about sending a screen shot of every one BEHIND this one
but nah
live in a .zip?
rofl
would you like to come live in a zip with me kaylee?
i think that would send the wrong impression

BUT,
it is essentially what i am doing

hence, fingers
need2goOutside
want2goOutside

project-go-outside.com
is the overall project
wasdf is the finger specific portion

project-go-outside.com bundles the arduino wasdf project with a compliant C++/Qt Free Software
Rasperry Pi Stack

wasdf is just the Arduino Software + the Serial Protocol / C++ impl (in Qt)

project-go-outside.com just happens to use wasdf as one of it's input methods
