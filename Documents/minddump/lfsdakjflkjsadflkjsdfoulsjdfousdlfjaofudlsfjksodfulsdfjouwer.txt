What if I get hurt (via attack from corrupt ass motherfucking politicians/etc)?
What if I don't launch?

Which of these two scenarios is worse, is the question. I deem the second to be worse because I lean towards agreeing with the old saying: "there's nothing worse than wasted talent". To me, not launching is wasting my life away. I don't want the long/slow/boring/SAFE life that not launching can/would give me. I want the exciting/fulfilling/engaging/moneys-worth life that launch can/will give me. The risk of an early death and/or physical attack from various entities is worth it... though I should still be aware of them and take measures to avoid them.

There, now I don't fear death (logically, although I still do and [probably (TODOoptional(had:req): panic training)] always will "in the moment") and I know what approach to take regarding my environment: launch but play it safe. It's convenient that I don't really like most people all that much: the less I interact with others, the less opportunity I provide them to fuck with me.
