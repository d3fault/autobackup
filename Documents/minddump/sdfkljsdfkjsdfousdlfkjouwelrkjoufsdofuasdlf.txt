Teeworlds bindings

When I'm playing teeworlds iDDRace and someone asks me "how do I summon a dummy?", my instinct is to tell them to press "4", which is what I have "say /d" bound to. The same goes for all my bindings in any game. We alive beings can only ever see and/or 'report' (tell) our bindings. We cannot report or know the underlying bound command. It is hard to say what I am trying to say, but it's related to that "you can't define any word in the dictionary without using a word also in the dictionary". Different life forms can/do have different bindings ("4"), but every life form has the same underlying command. Obviously this is all metaphor/analogy... but I can't really tell you precisely where/how it applies realistically. Perhaps I can't describe it because it is indescribeable. What I mean perhaps is that perhaps it is a dependency error. Blah.
