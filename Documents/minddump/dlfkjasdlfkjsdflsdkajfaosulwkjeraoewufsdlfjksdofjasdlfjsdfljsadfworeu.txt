It's a 1000% better to be than to know

Bitch, I _AM_ Steven...

I'm only on the part of the roller coaster where you're going up latched onto chains etc.... but I'm already like 20x higher than any other roller coaster made. Scared and excited as fuck. At the end of the ride the roller coaster flies off the tracks and explodes into the ground (RCT style rofl). Unless freeeeze/immortal worx ;-P


But I mean

I can look down/around and I see some of what I'm about to experience. A lot of cork screws and loop de loops and yea you get the fucking idea. I think at some point the roller coaster does a front flip and you are forced upwards out of your chair (my shit doesn't rotate like that 'X' ride). Should be interesting... hope I don't anurism (sp) from all the blood rushing to my brain.
