realization: basically everything i want to do has the dependency of a) ad agency and b) bitcoin payment processing

so an ad agency that modularly uses a bitcoin payment processor is my 2 core dependencies to enable me to make apps in the future that utilize both.
by themselves they also can/will generate money
though i doubt the bitcoin payment processor will on it's own (i'm not going to rent that as a SAAS or anything)

bluebox, should i ever make it, depends on the ad agency, can/will use it
d3fault can/will
massage exchange can/will
quickdinner
staticchan
69chan
whatever else i pull out of my ass
they all have that in common


to not depend on another ad agency
and to not depend on a 3rd party payment processor
life will be great.
