Logic of the psyche

I am immensely interested in the logic of the psyche, but I haver very little interest in Earth 2013 Psychology. Self important dildos running studies on people like mice, digging into their brains and writing shit down in notebooks. Your average psychologer has no passions and couldn't think of a better bachelors degree. They have a god complex over their subjects, as if none of the problems they study apply to them. Psychology doesn't dig into the depths of the brain, it just provides a crybaby clinic for wealthy panzies. Woe is me, my girlfriend won't suck my dick. "How does that make you feel?". That the question works so wonderfully is the very reason I've made so much progress alone: the shoulder you cry on is optional (and expensive). Earth 2013 psychologers, dig into your own brain. Lock yourself [alone] in a room with no windows and see where it takes you (SCARED MUCH!?!? (yes, I am a tough guy)).
