Time is infinite, time alive is finite (unless you consider that there are infnite duplicate finite lives and add their spans together like a dolt).

New subject:
Nothing matters, therefore everything matters... and among things that matter (or that don't -- take your pick), life matters infinitely more than everything else (while still not mattering or mattering alongside everything else).
