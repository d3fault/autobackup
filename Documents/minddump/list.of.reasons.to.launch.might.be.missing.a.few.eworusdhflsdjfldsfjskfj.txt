0) health
 a) physical
   i) sex addict (spiraling suicide). won't be post launch
  ii) wash hands etc role model. will be a neat freak because i'll know i'm setting an example for the world
 b) mental
   i) paranoia of being watched/jacked (causes expression deprivation)
  ii) imo, all thoughts should be serialized by default (the way [most] all more evolved humans live from the moment they are born)
1) scientific
 a) tutorial/academic value
 b) jumping back into train of thought (software is what is intended, but implementations tend to change ideas because of bugs/etc)
2) social
 a) copyleft bubble needs to be inflated with _something_ in order to expand (and inside a copyleft bubble is where i calculate sanity is located)
 b) re-touching 0-b-i: expression deprivation keeps me from communicating with family/friends. i notice myself holding back and i rage (incidentally, i hold back my rage too :-P)
