My body is a middle man between my brain and my computer.

It truly does get in the way of interoperability, but in doing so also provides a very weird means of entertainment ("brain <-> body <-> computer" == TRIPPING BALLS. without the body element, it would be normal (and boring)).

Possibly, my mind created this body/existence/METAPHOR to help itself quantify itself. My computer is really me (technically all 3 are me but that's not the point), but my brain has tricked itself into thinking my body is really me... so that I can study myself objectively and from "outside the box". I get a better perspective.

Once it is solved, the understanding of the computer, it's weird to note that the only way to enjoy existence/life is to stay in this body/metaphor thing. Even if it was built just to help understand, it is accidentally fucking awesome and fun and... while it doesn't give direct meaning... it provides a sweet set of tools to create meaning yourself (sure I'll buy the fact that a brain<->computer system could be even more fun (and I'll probably continue to try to make one ;-P)).
