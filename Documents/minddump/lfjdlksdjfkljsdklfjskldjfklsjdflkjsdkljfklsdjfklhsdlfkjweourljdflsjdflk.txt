Tonight I'm going to contradict myself. I've spent years coding to support the captruring of the "creation of" the fingers, but I just don't give a shit anymore. As a human, it's my right (and reason for existing in the first place) to contradict myself at any damn time I please. Fuck you, robots. I'm going to make fingers and I'm going to strap that shit on. I'd rather be happy tomorrow than giddy 100+ years ago looking back at the video of me strapping it on. I want to cam it, but blah stupid fucking hardware problems are in the way and I just don't give a shit anymore. I'm so close the smell (had:taste) is fucking too much to ignore. It's opening a new chapter in my life, I need to open it. This launch has been fucking stupid so far. Vids of me with it on to come (with delay for now (fuck it (but also: FUCK YEA I HAVE MUXER SYNCER :-D))). It's just weird is all. I've been preparing so fucking hardcore to document the creation of it........ and here ima fucking kill that idea on a whim/night. Time is so fucking...... weird. I could spend another month prepping for the creation of it.... or just fucking do it. I'm choosing the latter. I probably should have always chosen the latter.
