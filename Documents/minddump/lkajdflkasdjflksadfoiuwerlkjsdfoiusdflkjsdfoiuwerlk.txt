drugs should be legal because there is no god and the only meaning of life is a mental orgasm. drugs can help you achieve the state of mental orgasm. they can also give you a mental 'hell', if your brain is incorrectly organized/programmed. when i trip it is bliss. i have been through bad trips but they were all just demons/deficiencies working themselves out. the trips are not real so there is nothing to be afraid of. mind over matter. why are drugs illegal? because those in charge, those born before me, those less intelligent, are afraid of those trips.




.... it is definitely also true that those in charge (and hell, even me) are afraid of OTHER MINDS who are less organized and who might have a bad trip and TAKE FROM IT negativity and perhaps then do harm to others.


contradiction:
a) keep me safe from others taking drugs, losing their fucking minds, and going on a killing rampage
b) let me do drugs!!!! don't arrest me!!!! drugs should be legal!!!!



this is why i kind of think there should be a test of sorts to see if a brain is ready to take drugs. but eh perfecting that test and not letting any false positives through would be ridiculously hard if not impossible



perhaps i should just stay in the shadows and live a life of bliss/ecstacy????


alone


....which leads to paranoia (and also a waste of life if you value 'writing your name in the universal book' -cicero)



FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
