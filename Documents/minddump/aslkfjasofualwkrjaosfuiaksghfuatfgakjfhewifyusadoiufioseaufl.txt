i was thinking about something a little bit ago (it's not important what)

and i was anaylyzing it

oh wait i remember it

it was about schmidt

i cried at the ending


and analyzed the FUCK out of it

(side note: been a loooong time since i cried. felt good, especially given the analysis. keep reading)


i said something along the lines of: "i can analyze the cheesiness of this in one half of my brain but the other emotional half still caves because it is a good message/story"

...


"i will coexist with both halves communicating"


that's what launching is about


i will be analytical as fuck
and hopefully emotional as fuck

emotions are irrational

but they feel sooooooooooooo good

suppressing them is painful

keeping yourself in a state of analysis is not comfortable

you need to just let go
let it flow
let yourself go

analyze, emote

simultaneously


cry and explain to yourself (and your audience, but mostly for yourself) WHY you are crying

it's possible. i did it to the ending of about schmidt (not that it was complicated, it just happened to be the first time both halves of my brain communicated so well)
