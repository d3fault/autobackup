i understand infinity.
in understanding it alone, i gain immortality

infinite time
infinite space
infinite alternative universes
sure, i'm in this one
but i only ever know one
one stops, so be it
the others all continue

OR, the 'one' comes back
there is no such thing as death for me
before i was born i cannot remember
and after death i will never know
i am only alive
that is it~









...............THIS IS GOING TO MAKE DEALING WITH DEATH THAT MUCH HARDER IF NOBODY 'FINDS' THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH :(
meh, oh well
remember what you said
savor it
enjoy it
don't let the depression take you over
you'll be back here
you can count on that.

sweeet.

penn jillette is a pretty smart guy
thank you for that 4chan image

'if religion disappeared what replaces it would be more nonsense'
'if science disappeared someone else would discover it again'

that's pretty much me
i'd discover..... myself??
