Elaborating further (I didn't want to add this to the other doc because it's perfect/minimal as is): One man's "pursuit of happiness" putting more strain on another's "pursuit of happiness" is fine (or at least, much less (by an order of magnitude) stupid/evil/shit/inhumane). This is what people often refer to as "healthy competition". It's true, the need to compete DOES stimulate innovation. That argument is often referred to by capitalists. But they're overlooking the fact that most are only desperately trying to survive (or worse, they just don't care). We can (and will) still have innovation and competition when people don't have to struggle to survive.

I'd even go so far as to make the argument that allowing people to relax and let their mind's wander will increase innovation. Sure, there will be tons of people who waste their free time on tv/vidya/b/etc, but there's a comparatively large amount of intelligent humans who would use their free time to innovate/etc... if only they had that free time to begin with. Working 40 hour weeks sucks the life out of a man. Each night and weekend is spent recouping. Not enough time to sit and relax and drift and imagine and innovate. No time to live (read:enjoy life).

I've said before, but I'll re-touch on it: the pursuit of happiness is endless. For those successful at it, the pursuit itself becomes the means of happiness. Just like an addiction to gambling, they become addicted to making money. They don't stop, ever. It's inhumane that a man struggling to survive has to compete with another man's addiction to earning money. Additionally, it's easier to make money once you have money. So those at top are always stomping their feet on the heads of those beneath them, adding to their struggle [to survive (if it was just to be happy, it would be different (but there's still a[n] [less important] argument there too)].
