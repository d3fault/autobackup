Mastering programming is mastering making yourself understood. Computers are less complex to make understand [you(?)], although weirdly/funnily/somehow more error prone. Humans have more complexity, without a doubt, but they are much more effective (had:efficient) at recoverying from errors in explaination.

Mastering making yourself understood implicitly makes making yourself understood to humans easy as well, but that does not do-anything (had:go) for the mysterious (to me) skill of "small talk". I don't know it and I don't want to know it (it bores me).
