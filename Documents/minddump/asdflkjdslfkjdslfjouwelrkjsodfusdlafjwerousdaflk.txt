I need to launch minimally
I need to launch asep
because I have SO MANY PROJECTS
that are "on hold" until after I launch
fingers is my most anticipated tbh
I want to fucking make music!!!!!!!

I also want to be able to get out of this fucking chair and walk around and enjoy the scenery
while coding.

or dancing

but you get the idea

FUCK SITTING HERE

FUCK DEATH IN A CHAIR

my grandfather and my father

I WILL NOT


FUCK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUU


there are tons of others

this launch should be rushed
asep.

MAKE IT WORK

OPEN SOURCE IT
bugs can be fixed
bugs can be solved

tick tock


i need to keep things in perspective

Rpc Generator is useful as FUCK and can/will probably be used for inter-node communication on dream/d3fault project
there are so many places
infinite places

so it SEEMS tedious
because it is

code and forget~

it's a bigger accomplishment than you're giving it credit

it's also proving to be more difficult than you anticipated

BUT THE REWARDS

OH THE REWARDS

yessshhhhhhh

LGPL that shit at launch

and it will grow
HUUUUUUUUGE

there will be functionality added that you can't even conceive of

that's the 'beauty of open source'


guh

i'm so excited

i feel as though the past few months or however long i had forgotten what i am all about
why i am launching
it is not a means to an end
it is a starting point
RUSH TO THE STARTING POINT

_THEN_ you can perfect your little fucking heart out
it will all be documented
you won't have the stresses of survival to worry about
you can smoke fuckin weed all day err day
and code
and listen to
and make
music
and/or anything else you want

stop fucking procrastinating
you are dying
in that chair
that you're sitting in
this very moment


and if you don't do something about it
you'll be there until you die
your legs will cease to work
just like your grandfather
brilliant mathematician unable to walk
scary and gross

BUT ALSO very encouraging that i have a grip on what i want to do at such a young age
my grandparents are still alive and i already am diverting my path from their demise
learn from their mistakes
etc

others will learn from mine
that's besides the point


guh


|magic|messageSize|messageBody(incl. "header")|

the same needs to be used for the helloer i guess?

that's what i'm procrastinating on

hello future motherfuckers
i've been stuck on that problem for like a week
i mean
just staring at it
it's like I know the solution
but I'm just.......


idfk


scared?
procrastinating?
I just can't pound out the solution
even though I know it.



so much to do
so little time
I fucking hate myself
I wish I was launched
I wish I was alive

I am dead
in this chair
in the dark
3am
in silence (sans harperactive)

fuck.

woe is me
woe is me
bawwwwwwww thread


SHUT
THE
FUCK
UP
YOU
WHINY
BABY
AND
CODE
UNTIL
YOUR
FINGERS
ARE
DOWN
TO
THE
BONE
AND
IF
YOU
HAVEN'T
LAUNCHED
BY
THEN
KEEP
CODING
BECAUSE
FUCK
THIS
LIFE
