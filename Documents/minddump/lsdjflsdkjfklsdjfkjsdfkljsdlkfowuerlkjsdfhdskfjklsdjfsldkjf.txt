I can spurt my thoughts out into the universe, or I can keep them bottled up in my head, it really makes no difference in the real sense. But since it pleases me, I should become an extrovert.

What I mean by real in above sentence: no matter is ever introduced or lost by my going either way.
That's not to imply my emotions are not real, or that I'm not xD.
So your definition of real could change the definition of the sentence a ton.
