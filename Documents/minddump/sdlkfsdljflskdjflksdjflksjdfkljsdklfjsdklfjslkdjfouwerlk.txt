Since lobbying is legal, lobbying will probably always be legal. Therefore, it is justified for, and possibly even required of, us to murder all of our current politicians. We should replace them and all of the existing infrastructure as-is (otherwise there's a huge risk of collapse), but only after making illegal any/all forms of lobbying.

Funny/scary how close that paragraph gets to treason. I'm not inciting it, simply discussing it.
