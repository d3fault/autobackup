fuck man i feel like brainwash it overwhelming me lately
seriously what the fuck
collective conscious or what?

some movie/documentary on rlslog "everything is fine" or something fucking kills me
how is this

i theorize of actors dressing (with makeup) as younger versions of themselves (i fucking get paranoid in so many movies i watch lately... even popular ones [that i haven't seen (yet)]) and like them re-doing the movie and changing the script subtly to rip me off

but then i think/hope people that saw it back in the day would re-watch and notice


seriously so fucking paranoid
can't wait till i'm 100% libre and can stop giving a shit

i'm definitely losing my mind
BUT SO CLOSE TO GAINING IT BACK FUUUUUCK YYYYOOOUUUUUUU
