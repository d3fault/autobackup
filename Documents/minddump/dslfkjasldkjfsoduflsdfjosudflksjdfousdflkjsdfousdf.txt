Change the world or become rich? I know I have the skills required to become an billion dollars, but I'd rather change the world. ABC, once up and running, by itself could be sold for a few million easily. Nah fuck that, I'll just give away the source for free........ putting the news back (WAIT NO NOT BACK: FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER [in this instance (so yea i guess back)]) into the hands of the people. Bitcoin + "d3fault's single click instant motherfucking ad profiting news publishing stack" = win

...and I still consider ABC to be a piece of shit.
