-1) I started riding my bike out in this general area over the summer at night time. Went north on power then south on usery mountain road/ellsworth then back home to gilbert (every time since I did it opposite, since it's easier). The first time was both the most amazing, most tiring, and most scary. When I reached the edge of the city and realized the desert was much closer than I thought, a sense of amazement took me over. I took off my shirt to cool off and coasted down power rd toward the river with no hands on mah handlebars (WOWOW uJelly?) and just staring off into the stars. I'm still not sure if I was just out of shape as fuck or if that way really is that much more difficult. My legs were killing me and the weird thing is that it hurt to stop peddling O_o. I was also too scared to stop and rest, so I pushed my bike when I couldn't handle it anymore. Maybe that's why I was so damn tired: fear made me push myself harder than ever. My leg muscles were spazzing out for quite a while after I finished. The fear, though, that was the worst. This was before I read about the "30 deaths in past 100 years" statistic. I was freaking the fuck out thinking I was gonna get pounced. I used only my extremely-dim-because-of-low-batteries bike flashlight (it's law) most of the way. Eventually I put on my fully charged headlamp (ohi it's lighting up this ebook reader's screen as I type) and laughed at the different levels of brightness between the two. I got so used to the dim'ness of the first one that I thought it was normal. Yea sorry can't really explain the fear. Can't really explain fear in general. Terrified. But I will say facing death makes you appreciate life more. I was so afraid it was almost like tripping balls. I zoomed in from outer space onto myself on that dark road all alone, envisioning my death over and over. It makes you feel so alone and helpless. It amplified that truth even when you're not bike riding in the middle of nowhere. "We all die alone". Fear fucks with your head. That first bike ride changed me. I was only sort of slightly entertaining the idea of coming to camp out here at the time. Now that I'm here I've done much scarier SOUNDING (it's all in the eye of the beholder) things: I've walked around _IN_ bulldog canyon with no flashlight at all. I was just saving batteries. You gotta get into the head of the animals. Most of them are afraid of me. Mountain lions are rare... bears even rarer. What I WON'T do, though, is sit/stand-still in the dark out here [without a campfire]. Walking makes you intimidating to them, sitting/standing not so much. Coyotes (especially packs of them) are my only real concern. Ok anyways back to the topic. While riding my bike around these parts (on the road) I saw a skunk and shouted "OH SHIT A SKUNK!" in a moment of panic. I was using those words as both a means to vent my fear and a means of scaring the animal away. It worked, he high-tailed it out of there. Heh that figure of speech is actually accurate: he did raise his tail and almost (may have~) sprayed. I saw another skunk up ahead too, wtf? Not more than a few hundred feet except this time off in the bushes instead of in the fucking bike lane xD. Speakiing of "in the bike lane", that first "amazing" ride down power made me think that I'd probably have crashed and gotten rekt if a skunk was in the bike lane or some animal darted out in front of me. I ride a bit more careful/slower now, at least at night time with a weak flashlight :-P. Ok back on topic: and not more than a few hundred feet beyond that second skunk I became afraid for some reason and turned around to see if an animal was following me. Fuck me, there was some large-ish animal in the middle of the road and it may have been following/chasing me until I stood up on my bike to turn around to look. It was too dark to see, but scared the fucking shit out of me. I peddled faster and tried to make myself look bigger by standing. A car passed in the opposite direction, I tried to use their headlights to see if I could see the animal, but I couldn't. It may have just been a[nother] skunk crossing the road... but it may have been my old friend Mr. Mountain Lion.


0) At my first campsite, the first morning after I moved out, a little bird was hopping through my campsite I guess looking for food (or a mate (what else is there to do)). He hopped into my firepit that was still hot from either earlier that morning or the night before. I'm not sure if he squeaked but he definitely reacted quickly. He flew over onto a nearby branch then bent his entire upper body over so he could geta good look at his feet. I felt sorry for him, but it was also kind of funny, especially the way he bent over to look at his feet. Sort of how a child bends over/down to do a summersault.


1) When I was at my 3rd campsite (I was changing daily for the first few days), which I stayed at for a few weeks or maybe a month or two I forget, a javelina walked into my camp and scared the shit out of me. I always thought javelinas looked like pigs based on what I'd heard about them (they are members of the pig family so yea~). What walked into my camp was no cute pink piggy. Was a four legged hairy beast with a long ant-eater like neck (but much larger than an ant-eater). My first thought was: "ALIEN!". I jumped out of my chair, whipped out my bowie blade, yelled/slightly-screamed at it "what the fuck are you!?!?!?" (again, both to release fear and to inflict it). I guess it didn't see me at first, but my yelling got it's attention and it squealed and hopped over a bush in the exact opposite direction of me. It was kinda walking from my left to my right, but then it turned to the right to see me (I had a fire going and everything) before running/etc. Took me a while to deduce that it was a javelina.


2) Horses. horses everywhere. They scare me at night when I don't know what they are yet, and I scared them a lot at my 3rd campsite because it was next to one of their main trails. One day I got within 10-15ft of one as he was eating. I want to decrease that number until I can pet and even ride one. Thars an award-worthy pic of em drinking out of the river up on me website.


3) A coyote walked up on me in broad daylight. I could tell me heard me walking and was hunting me. We saw each other at the same time and he ran away in fear. I had a tiny bit of fear of course, was readying my knife... but it wasn't so bad and it ended pretty quickly. Saw another coyote in the distance once but he was pretty far away and running away from me. I hear packs of coyotes howling almost every night, sometimes they sound like they're tearing some unlucky animal to shreds.


4) A fucking skunk was getting into my food, tearing holes in plastic bags, and even coming back many nights in a row. At first I just said fuck it, but a few nights later I finally did more than just bang on my knife sheath with my knife  and bang on my tent wall with my hand: I went out with a flashlight/knife to see what it was. My guess was that it may have been a javelina or coyote, but my best guess was honestly a horse xD. The flashlight scared the skunk, and he high-tailed it out of there. There was a slight smell of his presence lingering after he left, but it wasn't a full on spray thankfully.


5) I saw 4 maybe 5 female (or just sans-horns) deer on a hill/mountain side. They were beautiful. I would have taken a picture if I had my stuff. I just stood there for a few minutes watching them. Could easily have keelt them if I had a gun/bow, but eh I had no desire to just saying that's how close they were.


6) A ground squirrel with giant balls (had:nuts) keeps walking into my camp mid-day. He's welcome. I watch him eat sunflower seed shells and pounce around on rocks and twigs like he's on the hunt. It's cute. I stay perfectly still and he works his way over to where I'm sitting. He was ~3ft from me today and he might have even crawled up on me if I didn't scare him off (out of my own fear) first. I kind of want him to climb on me for kicks, but eh I'm kind of a germophobe when it comes to wild animals.


9999) Reserved. This is the one that killed me. Sorry, I'm not available to describe it. Maybe if you're lucky there's some bitchin video footage.
