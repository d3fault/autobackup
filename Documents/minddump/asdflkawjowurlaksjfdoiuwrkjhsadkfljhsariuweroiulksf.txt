i think high apathy high security is the only way
say anything
say everything
trust no one ( i can never remember if i should write 'nobody' or 'no one' lol fuck brains lying is impossible )

that tangent is really the answer in a nutshell
it is ture
if you are public
you will be transparent

it is why no politician is public/transparent
an ugliness comes out
there is ugly in all of us

why can't i convince 'them' (myself?) of that

leave me alone
yes i deserve to die
chances are, so do you

now i guess what i'm hung up on
is...

is steven curtis wieler II any worse than the rest?

certainly he/i have made mistakes

but i cannot know that because i am not anybody else
i am only me

a perfect life is impossible
but am i below par?

is par even possible?
does it even exist?
does the concept itself exist?

'normalcy' or something

a snapshot (meaning, one point in time) of the average of norms

that's really it

so i mean yea i get it... you want to change norms
great

but are you the person to do it?

will you be eaten alive?

is this even a game of politics?

am i accepting input?

would be hard not to and probably also stupid not to

but then i am also playing their game

instead of making my own

stupid vs. creative

choose one.

wait what?
how is that a decision at all?

i choose creative

wait no

they go hand in hand
see i'm so lost
what am i even thinking?

stupid because i disconnect
createive because i disconnect
so it isn't choose one

they go hand in hand

well i still choose creative

because what's the alternative?

smart/silent/sitting-there-doing-nothing

exactly.

so do not be afraid to look stupid

regardless of your stupidity

which you certainly have plenty of

i guess that's what i'm getting at... everybody has some stupid

impossible not to

enter enter

i am writing a fucking poem or some shit

my life dictated

really just my thoughts poured into notepad

too bad i don't trust anyone

....working on that

not on trusting people

but on speaking without needing to trust anyone

fuck people

fuck everyone

which means me too?

or something~

/b/

random

product of evolution

product of insantiy

of course we're stupid

don't be afraid of death

it will come
