There are so many wrong left and right turns from here (for Earth in 2014, not talking about me (though that's true too)), and we'll take all of them for a few (hopefully brief) moments until someone good stands up and says "no".

I like to suck my own dick and think I'm saying "no" to an age-old bullshit/broken/insanity-provoking system/path called "copyright"
