despite my urge to kill and "be evil" because it would be entirely fun,
math demands that i resist
man demands that i am genetically programmed to resist
else [other instances of] myself kill myself myself

but the other instances of myself that still defy that mathematical guarantee (given by the fact that we're surviving) do exist
we will never have 100%
never can
never will


oops meant math not man, but maybe subconsciously i meant man? or maybe intentionally? but what do math and man have to do with each other? everything. we are math-driven.
