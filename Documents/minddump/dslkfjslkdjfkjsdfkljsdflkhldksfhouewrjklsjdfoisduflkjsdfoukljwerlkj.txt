The safest way to exist is to not say a single thing. I hate that fact. Imagine a graph and a line that should be blipping up and down and shit like a sine or fuck who knows (rand()) wave. now imagine it at zero and not moving. That is the safest (and ARGUABLY, "smartest"), way to live. I argue against that. Or, I don't know what iI argue. There is a problem that needs solving somewhere around here, that's all I know.

I have said a metric fuck ton without saying anything at all.
