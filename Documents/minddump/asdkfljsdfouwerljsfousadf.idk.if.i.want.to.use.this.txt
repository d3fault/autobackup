keyboard layout: a e i o u r t s then more very frequently used letters, with the most frequently used on your userDecidedLeftOrRightHandedPreference. if they are left handed, that pattern is done backwards and RTL.
there needs to be a universal "go back" trigger. finger and keyboard command.
i could, for example, do: left pinky pull while left ring finger pull = z and x being pressed at the same time. maybe ctrl + zx. they are not meant to be done the same way.


right now you are holding onto it
"don't flood"

i hope to someday not have that limitation

i need my own network for that

but there arleady exist plenty. use them as backup.
