The back of the book should be a/my bare ass. Even if clothed (whitey tighties would maximize hilarity if clothing is chosen) because of censored-by-publisher reasons, it would still be kinda funny. With the front being my giant grinning face and that being the back, idk how to explain it but it's err like emphasizing that the words are me. Bleh anyone with 1% of a human brain would get it. Why am I styll tiping?
