My favorite contradiction ever (so far):
It is better to be overly paranoid, because if you aren't, then you are not paranoid enough and therefore compromised.
It is better be on the more fulfilling (albeit semi-dangerous) life, than to be on the "cautious just to stay alive"... side of things... because if you are only ever "cautious to stay alive", you never live a fulfilling life.

Man the second one was hard to word and yea they are KINDA saying the same thing (except contradicting each other).

a) Overly paranoid, because otherwise you aren't paranoid enough
b) Fulfilling life, because otherwise you aren't fulfilled enough (or at all)


I wish I could decipher this logic further. It almost appears as though the two work together, one tugging away from 0% toward 50% (never reaching 50% (the "sweet spot" in this analogy/metaphor/thingo)), the other tugging away from 100% toward 50% (ditto).

But IDK... you do have to (err, not necessarily, but it is ridiculously difficult to hit the sweet spot) be on one side or the other as the 50%... so wtf? Which is better? My brain hurts.
