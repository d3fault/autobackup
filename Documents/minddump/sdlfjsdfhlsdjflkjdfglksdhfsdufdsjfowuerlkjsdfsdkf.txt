I never will get to see the influence I've had on my peers.

if(i am still alive) //a requirement to my observing the influence
{
	they will doubt my infinite multiverse theory stuff and chalk it all up as luck
}
else(i die in that universe)
{
	small chance they read my bullshit and see that i didn't die, i just err ehh uhm reduced the amount of universes i exist in (the ones that kill me sucked anyways ;-P) and live on in other ones (the ones that don't kill me are pro (even though they'll doubt my stuff and chalk it  all up as luck))... err sry digressed... small chance they read my bullshit and follow my lead. even if i were alive and they read/followed, there is a high probability that from my perspective _THEY_ now die
