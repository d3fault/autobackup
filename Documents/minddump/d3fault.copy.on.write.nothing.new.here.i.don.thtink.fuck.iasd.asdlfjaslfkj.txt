d3fault: copy on write

so basically the network should abstract, similar to how Qt does, the copy-on-write mechanism

doing so securely may prove a challenge
but it's gotta be possible


and another concern is: do i do a full copy of the data... or just a diff with the new data?

one's more efficient during runtime, one's more efficient with disk space

i think i've theorized about this before and have concluded: diffs for permanent storage, full copy for cache data serving
best of both worlds



but i am getting off the point


the point is that it is IMPOSSIBLE to overwrite previous data
from your perspective, you have overwritten it
but the trusted servers correlate with each other to ensure that never happens
even deleting a piece of data is impossible
they can appear to have deleted it... but the old data/revision still remains


nothing too revolutionary/new in this article... but i've never really thought of it as 'copy on write' before
