each time i type my password for my passwords db in my online computer, i'm potentially leaking information that could get me killed by the mafia. i need to upgrade my security. new password database, new password for truecrypt archive on 1tb. assume compromised. i'm retarded. of course, that's just one universe that isn't necessarily happening. wondering eats my brain. i contemplate way too many universes. my head hurts. sometimes i just wanna eat my shotgun. that may one day be my option presented to me: eat my shotgun or my family members will be picked off one by one. that's how they operate. retaliate, and they retaliate even further (more family members). i want to say "if you don't think about it it won't happen", but that's completely untrue. i'd bite the bullet for any one of my family members.... even though i obviously don't want to. this is a very depressing document. could i even prevent it? could i gain enough power to be immune to it? i have no idea. money speaks... negotiating'wise, that is...
