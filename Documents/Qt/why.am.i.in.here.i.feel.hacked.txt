just smoked spice
my logic is implementable

i talk to myself out loud and learn from it
talking/thinking to myself and recording it
my logic is implementable
talking is just logic
walking through the logic
i can/should completely zone out
i need to give myself work
like a high level design and then set a set of requirements for each "item"
and then just walk through them linearly
i can simplify the thinking process indefinitely(i haven't found a spot where i couldn't abstract something?)
high level design
requirements design
timeline / requirements order of implementation (individualization of each so i can derive anything and either customize it or make it one step closer to machine code.
