c++ qt quick something, but how2organize? frontend/backend folders with main.cpp and SPECIFIC_TO_APP_test.h/.cpp right next to main.cpp? test connects the frontends/backends (which i should randomly mention, i should from now on utilize git submodules to properly re-use and/or version/etc) which are oblivious of each other. the only thing i like about qml is that it has a nice frontend/backend divide. i am jealous of that.
