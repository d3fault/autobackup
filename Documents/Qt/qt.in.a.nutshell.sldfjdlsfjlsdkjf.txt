If all of your "action/business-logic" objects/classes are/inherit-from QObjects and they all communicate with each other ONLY using signals/slots (or QMetaObject::invokeMethod) with a Qt::AutomaticConnection, and all of the "data" types that they work on and communicate to each other are implicitly shared, then your application will be thread safe (assuming you don't break other thread safety rules) no matter which thread each action object is on. Each action object can be on it's own separate thread, or they can all share the main thread.
