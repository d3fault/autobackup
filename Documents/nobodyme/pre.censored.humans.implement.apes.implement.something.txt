i just watched every planet of the apes released so far in the past 2-3 days
and i wrote this function in a textpad on my non-sync'd linux box and then didn't save it
it summarizes all the planet of the apes movies

while(true)
{
	humans.enslave(apes);
	apes.revolt();
	apes.enslave(humans);
	humans.revolt();
}


i didn't consider it worth saving (or posting to facefuck as i originally intended(i tend to bitch out with a lot of my shit... but i'm glad i launched nobodyme finally wooo))
but it did lead me into a series of other thoughts that i am now considering worth writing/documenting

class Human : Ape

class Ape : Something //see "this is something" nobodyme shit

there's obviously a string of species in between Ape and Something, but i ain't no fucking evolutionary biologist(?) so i don't know or care what they are

still, it made me think of how this "Something" was initially just an inanimate spec of dust (a single atom)
an inanimate spec of dust that merged/mutated with other specs until it gained the ability to clone/reproduce itself (there must have been plenty of lifelike specs that did NOT contain the ability to clone themselves and died off right away)
from there, it continued to evolve/mutate until... well shit... until it became smart enough to write this goddamn sentence (and it will continue to evolve/mutate with it's own intelligence assisting it. we develop cures in medicine that would take the normal adapt/mutate/evolve method millions of years to accomplish)



you know, i think i'm going to censor/htmlize this and post it on nobodyme lol...

fffuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccckkkkkkk cennsssssoooooorrrrrrrshhhhhhhhiiiiiiipppppppp but yea the facebook stuff is kinda irrelevant lol, same with my linux box stuff
