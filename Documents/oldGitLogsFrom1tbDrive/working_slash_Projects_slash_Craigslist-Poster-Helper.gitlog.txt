    everything's ugly as fuck now eh because i added login captcha detection (which has since gone away). need to refactor the FUCK out of this... but want to get it working first. anyways i'm
    gonna make a prototype to see if my code for setting the label to an image is right. i've seen the image data in the debug function ~~~~~

    changed all of the posts except for the actual ad post itself to use application/x-www-form-urlencoded instead of multipart/form-data

    got to the captcha page. didn't test it but maybe i did i forget. either way pretty sure it works. i'm going to go back and change all the previous POSTs to x-url-encoded instead of all being
    multipart/form type POSTs. all of them except the actual ad post i believe. should be easy to change... but committing in case i break some shit

    eh going to have to do the special logic method apparently, but shouldn't be too hard. if(file_exists(blah)) etc. also, it only APPEARS to be working... as in i got to the preview page and
    everything looks peachy. i did not sniff the traffic (because i don't know how to sniff https traffic in wireshark) to make sure that the blank filenames are even being uploaded... but
    craigslist didn't complain, so eh... idk..

    the current way i have image file posting set up SEEMS correct to me, but it doens't work with a blank filename. my browser seems to be fine with sending a blank filename. i'm going to try
    doing CURLOPT_FILENAME without CURLOPT_FILE... but then i'm going to need special logic to switch between the two depending on whether or not the user is actually uploading a file. i wish
    libcurl would just accept no filename and just do it just like the browser

    got to where i read all the (weirdly named) input fields from the CREATE POSTING html. tested, working. now need to make curl mimic the submit... and later on need to submit images/etc too.
    fuck where am i going to have images in the List<ItemsToPost*> ?? I guess a path to a local image will do idk, i'll deal with that later. also is more work for when I code a list generator for
    a client etc...

    added a version 2 design based on user interactions instead of parsing html... about to refactor code to get me out of like 12 curly brackets. gonna reverse the logic the return null for fails

    successfully emulated clicking 'Go' button after logging in. fuck yea. fixed a bug where redirect URLs would break if they had a colon in them. aka http:// ... doesn't affect relative URLs. i
    need to remember to do CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER bullshit every time i use curl to POST something so i don't get 100 CONTINUE http status bullshits that seem to break my shit. fuckers.

    oh god what a pain in the ass. how was it even working earlier? i fixed the login sequence but there's still a few bugs that are probably more mangeable. QString.toLocal8bit() returns a
    temporary variable that if not stored (see the random ass QByteArrays), get deleted from memory and fuck everything up. the solution was easy, figuring out the problem was a royal pain in the
    ass. fuck.

    eh coded up to after the clicking of the "go" button to start posting... it looks like it would work, even compiles... but now my old code for logging in isn't working. maybe there's a
    recaptcha on the login page (saw it once before), idfk. going to revert to the old/working commit and investigate.

    refactored code to have business logic on a different thread so the gui doesn't have to ever block. not yet tested, but compiles.

    adding initial repo with compiling functionality and basic design. going to move all the business logic into a separate thread so i can block it until the user responds to the captcha (on the
    gui thread)
