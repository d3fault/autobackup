    got Phonon:VideoPlayer (as opposed to Phonon::VideoWidget) working with a QUrl. it's pretty fucking picky. load(MediaSource) doesn't work, but play(MediaSource) does. i'm not sure if this
    solution will let me SAVE + STREAM the file though, as i want the final app to do. still, STREAM by itself is probably good enough :)

    adding working sample that only plays videos from hard drive. for some reason QUrl (commented out) doesn't work. oh well, i plan on getting the bytes off the net from either
    QNetworkAccessManager or curl (so i can save + stream at same time)
