    hacky basic prototype with no audio and crappy sync'ing. BUT IT WORKS. decoder thread sleeps for 33ms after each decode, render thread (which isn't even implemented yet) sleeps 30ms after
    presenting the frame to the GUI. the reason for these sleeps is so they don't overwrite them before they can be played. still need to implement a buffer, renderer, and use audio

    compiling but not tested. added the GUI front end but still need to test it. not sure if QtLibAV should have subThreads or just do all the work itself. plus thinking about how to sync with
    audio design

    initial commit. it is in a debugging state that doesn't use threads very well, but it works. it saves every 100th frame as a .png for about 1500 before it crashes. oshi-, probably running out
    of memory
